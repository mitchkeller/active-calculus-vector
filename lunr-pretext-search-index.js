  "title": "Features of the Text",
  "body": " Features of the Text  Similar to the presentation of the single-variable Active Calculus , instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:   Motivating Questions.  At the start of each section, we list motivating questions that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.    Preview Activities.  Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by a preview activity . This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students in advance of class, and indeed to be completed by students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.    Activities.  Every section in the text contains several activities . These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working either individually or in small groups.    Exercises.  There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat a large list of standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable calculus problems. In this text, each section begins with several anonymous WeBWorK exercises, and follows with several challenging problems. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in the .html version of the text . Almost every non- WeBWorK problem has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available APEX Calculus text by Greg Hartmann et al.    Graphics.  As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. The figures and the software to generate them have been created by David Austin.    Summary of Key Ideas.  Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.    Links to technological tools.  Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus are best understood dynamically, and we encourage readers to make frequent use of technology to analyze graphs and data. Since technology changes so often, we refrain from indicating specific programs to use in the text. However, aside from computer algebra systems like Maple , Mathematics , or Sage , there are many free graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces or curves. These programs can be used by instructors and students to assist in the investigations and demonstrations. The use of these freely available applets is in accord with our philosophy that no one should be required to purchase materials to learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise to be openly shared. Below is a list of a few of the technological tools that are available (links active at the writing of this edition). Of course, you can find your own by searching the web.       Wolfram Alpha , useful for graphing surfaces in 2D and 3D, and for general calculations     Wolfram Alpha widgets , searchable site for simple to use programs using Wolfram Alpha     GeoGebra , all purpose graphing tool with some computer algebra capabilities. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon allows you to search a large database of GeoGebra applets.     CalcPlot3D , good all-purpose 3D graphing tool     A collection of Flash Mathlets for graphing surfaces, parametric curves in 3D, spherical coordinates and other 3D tools. Requires Flash Player.

  "body": " Vector Calculus Preface  We are glad to have the opportunity to contribute the chapter on to expand Active Calculus - Multivariable . This chapter is currently in draft form , but ready for testing. We have tried to adhere to the style of the Active Calculus series of texts as much as possible. Sections begin with Motivating Questions and end with a summary that answers those questions. Each section has a preview activity and several activities intended for classroom use.  Recognizing that not all institutions will cover all the material in this chapter, we have intended that the overview of vector fields, line integrals of vector fields, and ( ) can be combined with on . We would encourage you to explore the section on curl before proceeding to , but only the first portion on circulation density would be terribly beneficial. does make some passing backward references to the development of divergence in , but it is not necessary to cover divergence in order to do the basics of circulation density and then .  Observant faculty may notice that the graphics in our chapter deviate from those in the previous 11. Because so much of vector calculus relies upon visualizing things in three dimensions, we elected to produce almost all of the graphics using SageMath. This allows for a degree of consistency between the two-dimensional graphics, which are typically static, and the three-dimensional graphics, which are almost always interactive. Thus, you can grab a three-dimensional plot, rotate it, zoom in on it, etc.  To rotate a three-dimensional graphic, click and drag with your mouse.  To zoom on an interactive three-dimensional graphic, use your mouse's scroll wheel or make your operating system's scroll gesture on your touchpad.  To move a three-dimensional graphic instead of rotating, hold down the space bar while clicking and dragging.    Notice that is a work in progress in a few ways:  Answers and solutions to many activities are not yet written.   WeBWorK exercises have not yet been added.  Some sections lack exercises altogether.  Sections on line integrals and surface integrals of scalar functions are yet to be added.  We welcome suggestions of WeBWorK exercises that faculty think would be good inclusions as well as suggestions for exercise topics. We also welcome feedback on any aspect of this chapter. We have set up a Google Form to collect feedback. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has delayed a final release of these materials. Perhaps by August 2022, they will be ready in a complete, public form, but we hope you continue to find them useful until then.   Mitchel T.

  "title": "Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals",
  "body": " Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals  Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.  While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas an author presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a main purpose of this work is to present a new multivariable calculus text that is free . In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source .  In Active Calculus - Multivariable , we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.  This approach is consistent with the following goals:   To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.    To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable calculus are natural and true. We strive to accomplish this by using specific cases to highlight the ideas for the general situation using contexts that are common and familiar.    To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multivariable calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, through working on activities in small groups in class, and through doing substantial exercises outside of class time.    To strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable calculus.     "

  "title": "How to Use this Text",
  "body": " How to Use this Text  Because the text is free, any professor or student may use the electronic version of the text for no charge. For reading on laptops or mobile devices, the best electronic version to use is the .html version of the text , but you can find links to a pdf and hard copy of the text at https:\/\/activecalculus.org\/ . Furthermore, because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the full set of source files, which are available on GitHub .  This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivariable calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. Chapter introduces functions of several independent variables along with tools that will be used to study these functions, namely vectors and vector-valued functions. Chapter studies differentiation of functions of several independent variables in detail, addressing the typical topics including limits, partial derivatives, and optimization, while Chapter provides the standard topics of integration of multivariable functions.     Electronic Edition  Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them. Also, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to on-line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer. The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone.   Note. In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links, so some availalable information is suppressed. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.    Activities Workbook  Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development.    Community of Users  Because this text is free and open-source, we hope that as people use the text, they will contribute corrections, suggestions, and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate such feedback is by email to Steve Schlicker at schlicks@gvsu.edu .     "

  "title": "Vector Fields",
  "body": " Vector Fields     What is a vector field?    What are some familiar contexts in which vector fields arise?    How do we draw a vector field?    How do gradients of functions with partial derivatives connect to vector fields?      Thus far vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in and . The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. That is, a curve is a function that takes as input a real number and produces a vector in or . In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take as input a point in or a point in and produce a vector (typically in or , respectively).    It's common for weather forecasters to discuss the wind speed , but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at 10 without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing. If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. (Perhaps you are taking off in a hot air balloon and need to know which direction the chase team should head to keep track of you.) Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind velocity at every point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).    Suppose that given a point in the plane, you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector . For example, we'd then know that at the point , the wind velocity is . In the table below, fill in the wind velocity vectors for the given points.                                                  The vector field takes the coordinates of the point and reverses them to make the components of the vector. Thus, . The remaining vectors are shown in the table below.                           Suppose that we associate the vector to a point in the plane. Complete the table below by giving the vector associated to each of the given points.                                                                 Note that another way of writing is . Thus, , for example. The remaining answers are found in the table below.                                      A table of values of these vector-valued functions is useful, but perhaps even better is a method of visualizing the vectors. In keeping with our wind velocity analogy, if , we draw the vector with its tail at the point . Using the first set of axes in , plot the vectors for the five points in the table in part . The example is drawn for you.  Using the second set of axes in , plot the vectors for the eight points in the table in part .  Axes for plotting some vectors from and .

Examples of Vector Fields  As showed you, a velocity vector field is an example of a scenario where associating a vector to each point in a region is useful. We denote such a vector field by or , where the vector associated to the point or is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.   An illustration of some of the vectors in a fluid velocity vector field. \"PIVlab multipass\" by Willa Licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons.   Green vectors representing the velocity vectors of a flowing fluid. The vectors along the vertical axis of symmetry are directed from bottom to top and are longest in the middle. Vectors on either side of the vertical axis of symmetry form circular rotation patterns, clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. In the upper left corner, there is an inset figure that enlarges the center of rotation on the left side of the image.    Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects. The force is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth, and its magnitude is determined by the distance between the object and the earth. An illustration of this vector field can be seen in , where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at that distance.   Gravitational vector field.       Mathematical Vector Fields  As suggested in the introduction and , vector fields can be given by formulas.    A vector field vectorfield definition in -space is function whose value at a point is a -dimensional vector . Similarly, in -space, a vector field is a function whose value at the point is a -dimensional vector.    Since is a vector, it has , , and components. Each of these components is a scalar function of the point , and so we will often write .  For example, if , then , , and . Any time we are considering a vector field , the definitions of functions , , and should be assumed in this manner. (For a vector field in -space, we only have the functions and , defined analogously.)    Plotting Vector Fields   gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields and . It would be impossible to sketch all of the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching by hand many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computer algebra systems can do a great job of making such sketches. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors are typically scaled in these plots, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in the text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field in .   Two plots of from a computer algebra system    A vector field in the plane with both axes ranging from to . Vectors point from the point to the point .    A vector field in the plane with both axes ranging from to . Vectors are shorter closer to the origin and longer farther away. At the left and right sides, the vectors follow arcs oriented clockwise. At the top and right sides, the vectors follow arcs oriented counterclockwise.     The left plot shows some of the vectors but accurately depicts all of their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand, especially along the lines and . The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform scaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vector's direction is completely accurate, but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the relative magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.    The plot in illustrates the vector field .   The vector field   A vector field plotted in the plane with and both ranging from to . The vectors have a counterclockwise rotation about the origin, with vectors getting progressively longer as they get farther from the origin.     Starting with one of the vectors near the point , sketch a curve that follows the direction of the vector field . To help visualize what you are doing, it may be useful to think of the vector field as the velocity vector field for some flowing water and that you are imagining tracing the path that a tiny particle inserted into the water would follow as the water moved it around.  Repeat the previous step for at least two other starting points not on the curve you previously sketched.  What shape do the curves you sketched in the previous two steps form?  Verify that is orthogonal to .  What is the relationship between the function and the vector ?  What does this tell you about the relationship between and circles centered at the origin? What is the relationship between and the radius of the appropriate circle?     Gradient Vector Fields  Without using the terminology, we've actually already encountered one very important family of vector fields a number of times. Given a function of two or three variables, the gradient of is a vector field, since for any point where has first-order partial derivatives, assigns a vector to that point.   In there are three sets of axes showing level curves for functions , , and , respectively. Sketch at least six vectors in the gradient vector field for each function. In making your sketches, you don't have to worry about getting vector magnitudes precise, but you should ensure that the relative magnitudes (and directions) are correct for each function independently.

The axes range approximately from to .       Seven equally-spaced lines with slope plotted on axes that range approximately from to . The lines are labeled from to increments of .       Axes ranging from to . In each quadrant, there are nested curves that appear like rounded squares far out and proceed toward circles in the middle. The curves are all labeled with either or .      Verify that is a gradient vector field by finding a function such that . For reasons originating in physics, such a function is called a potential function for the vector field .  Is the function found in part unique? That is, can you find another function such that but ?  Is the vector field a gradient vector field? Why or why not?     Summary     A -dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of whose value is a -dimensional vector. A -dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of whose value is a -dimensional vector.    Vector fields arise in familiar contexts such as wind velocity, fluid velocity, and gravitational force.    Vector fields are generally plotted in ways that ensure the direction and relative magnitudes of the vectors sketched are correct instead of ensuring that each vector's magnitude is depicted correctly.    The gradient of a function of two or three variables is a vector field defined wherever has partial derivatives.          Compute and sketch the vector assigned to the points and by the vector field .                 , we substitute , , in . We get Similarly, is obtained by substituting , , in .

  "title": "The Idea of a Line Integral",
  "body": " The Idea of a Line Integral     What is an oriented curve and how can we represent one algebraically?    What is the meaning of the line integral of a vector-valued function along a curve and how can we estimate if its value is positive, negative, or zero?    What are important properties of the line integral of a vector-valued functions along a curve?      As we discussed in , vector fields are often useful as representations of forces such as gravity, wind, and flowing water. We learned in that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail of its displacement vector to the tip. However, things get more complicated when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves. For example, how much work is done by a wind of 30 toward the northwest on an airplane that's flying 500 due north? What if the wind gets weaker the farther north the plane gets? In this section, we begin investigating how integration can be used to calculate the work a force field does in such circumstances.    Recall from that the work done by a force on an object that moves with displacement vector is . In this Preview Activity, we consider the work done by a wind blowing due east at 45 on an airplane at various stages of its journey.    A pilot flies for an hour and finds that he is 300 from where he started at a heading of 20 degrees east of due north. Find the work the wind has done on the airplane during the flight.     Here . The displacement vector of the airplane is . Thus, the work done by the wind is .    An hour later, the pilot determines that he is 275 due north of where he previously checked his position. Find the work done by the wind on the airplane during the second hour of the flight.     The displacement vector is . Thus, the work done by the wind is .    Find the pilot's displacement from his original position after two hours of flying and use that to find the work done by the wind on the airplane during the first two hours of flight.   ;   The displacement is . The work done by the wind is thus .    How does your answer to the previous part connect to the answers to the first two parts?   Sum.   It is the sum of the answers to the first two parts.    Suppose that the pilot then flies 45 west of due north for 200 . Find the work done by the wind on the airplane during this part of the journey.     The displacement vector is . The work is therefore .      Orientations of Curves  Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern ourselves with how the object moves. In particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point to the point by first going up the -axis to and then moving horizontally to than if the object moves along the line segment from directly to . Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the object moves from to directly along a line segment. We say that a curve in or is oriented if we have specified the direction of travel along the curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.    For each curve below, find a parametrization of the curve. Ensure that each curve's orientation matches the one specified.    The line segment in from to .   for   The direction vector for the line segment is . The line segment starts at . Thus, the line segment given as the vector-valued function .    The line segment in from to .   for   The direction vector for the line segment is . The line segment starts at . Thus, the line segment given as the vector-valued function .    The circle of radius (in ) centered at the origin, beginning at the point and proceeding clockwise around the circle.   for   We can parametrize the circle in question in a clockwise direction as . To get the correct starting point, we require .    In , the portion of the parabola from the point to the point .   for   Here we can let and for .    Notice that there are, in general, many ways to parametrize an oriented curve. With line segments, it is common to have the parameter range from to , although there are sometimes good reasons to choose another method. For circles and ellipses, you may find it useful to interchange the placement of and to change the orientation, but then careful attention may need to be paid to the start and end points. The interactive graphing applet below allows you to plot parametric curves. Click the Animate button to trace out the curve from your lower value of to your upper value of . (Type enter\/return on your keyboard to update the graph after editing a text box.) For curves in , check the Restrict view to 2D for ease of viewing.   A CalcPlot3D applet to explore oriented curves      Line Integrals  Just as when we differentiated a vector-valued function to find a tangent vector, we begin by dividing a curve oriented from a point to a point into small, straight pieces. Each of these pieces is in an area where the vector field is nearly constant, provided we use enough pieces. In , we show this situation. Each is the tip of a vector that traces out the curve, which makes the vectors (shown in blue) approximate the curve . The green vectors are the vectors in the vector field at each of the designated points along the curve.   A curve oriented from the point to the point . The tips of the vectors that trace out the curve are shown as points. The blue vectors are the , while the green vectors are the vectors associated to each of the points by a vector field .   An oriented curve from a point to a point . The curve is broken up by points that are the tips of position vectors as points along the curve. Blue vectors from to are drawn to approximate the curve. At each , there is also a green vector depicting the element of the vector field with tail at that point.    If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. This is because if the vector along the curve and the force field vector point in similar directions, the dot product will be positive. We are abusing notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of is points in or , and is a vector. By , we mean , where . On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. Taking the sum over , we have a Riemann sum that approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft as it flies along : .  This suggests the following definition.    Let be an oriented curve and a vector field defined in a region containing . The line integral line integral definition of along is , provided the limit exists.     Alternative notation for line integrals  Our notation for line integrals is one of several common notations. This notation's strength is that it emphasizes the role of a vector field and dot product. Another common notation for the line integral of a vector field along a curve is . This notation is common in physics and engineering. We will limit ourselves to the notation in the body of the text, but some exercises may use alternative notation.   The limit in exists provided that is a continuous vector field, by which we mean that each component function of is continuous as a function of or variables, and that is a piecewise smooth curved traced out from its initial point to its terminal point without retracing any portion of the curve.  Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral can each be viewed as the work done by as an object moves along the (very small) vector , the line integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object that moves along (in the direction of its orientation).    Shown in are two vector fields, and and four oriented curves, as labeled in the plots. For each of the line integrals below, determine if its value should be positive, negative, or zero. Do this by thinking about if the vector field is helping or hindering a particle moving along the oriented curve, rather than by doing calculations.   Vector fields and oriented curves      A vector field radiating from the origin with vectors getting longer as distance from the origin increases. There is an oriented line segment labeled from to and an oriented line segment labeled from to .       A vector field with all vectors parallel to the -axis.

The portion of that lies in the third quadrant is oriented in the opposite direction of the vector field. On the other hand, the portion of in the first quadrant is oriented in the same direction as . By symmetry, this forces .        Negative   The angle between the vectors of and are all obtuse. Thus, the line integral is negative.        Negative   The angle between the vectors of and are all obtuse (except for , where there is no angle), and thus the line integral is negative.        0   The vector field is always orthogonal to . Thus, the line integral is .    The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to calculate line integrals. As with the limits in the definition of every other type of integral we've studied so far, the limit in the definition of the line integral is is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in the case where the oriented curve is composed of horizontal and vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a single-variable integral, as the following example shows.    Consider the constant vector field . Let be the curve that follows the horizontal line segment from to and then continues down the vertical line segment to . shows and , including the orientation. Calculate    An oriented curve from to in a vector field .   The constant vector field as well as an oriented curve consisting of the line segment from to followed by the line segment from to .      To calculate , we start by working with the horizontal line segment. Along that part of , notice that . Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line integral along this portion of consists of terms of the form . Along this part of , ranges from to , and thus we can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral . Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that agrees with the orientation of , we are not surprised to have a positive value here.  Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of . Here , which means that . Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite integral . Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match the orientation of . Also, the negative value should not be unexpected, since is oriented in a direction for which the vectors of point in a direction that would hinder motion along .  Combining these two calculations, we find that .      Properties of Line Integrals  In , we implicitly made use of the idea that if can be broken up into two curves and such that the terminal point of is the initial point of , then the line integral of along is the sum of the line integrals of along and along . Recalling the property for definite integrals that tells us , the ability to work with line integrals in this way is probably not surprising.  Before stating some useful properties of line integrals, we will establish some convenient notation. If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of definite integrals.   Properties of Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , vector fields and , and oriented curves , , and , the following properties hold:                   .         shows a vector field as well as six oriented curves, as labeled in the plot.

The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the lower half of the circle of radius centered at oriented counterclockwise. The curve is the line segment from to .      Is positive, negative, or zero? Explain.   Negative   The portion of the vector field that produces acute angles with has small magnitude than the portion that produces obtuse angles. Thus, the line integral must be negative.    Let . Determine if is positive, negative, or zero.   Negative   Notice that is orthogonal to and . Thus, . Where the magnitude of the vectors in is larger, points in the opposite direction as the orientation of . Thus, is negative.    Order the line integrals below from smallest to largest.      Notice that is the only one of the six line integrals that is positive, so it is the largest. Since is orthogonal to and , . Note that while is twice as long as , the vectors in the vector field that are hindering are more than twice as long as those hindering Thus, . We do not yet have all the tools necessary to calculate the exact value of . However, it is greater than . Thus, the ordering is .      The Circulation of a Vector Field  If an oriented curve ends at the same point where it started, we say that is closed . oriented curve closed The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation circulation of around . To emphasize the fact that is closed, we sometimes write for . Circulation serves as a measure of a vector field's tendency to rotate in a manner consistent with the orientation of the curve.    Determine if the circulation of the vector field around each of the closed curves shown in is positive, negative, or zero.   Vector fields and closed curves    A vector field with vectors pointing along circles centered at the origin and in a clockwise direction. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases. Also shown is the circle of radius centered at the origin. The circle is oriented clockwise.    A vector field with all vectors parallel to the -axis. Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases. Vectors with point in the positive -direction, while vectors with point in the negative -direction. Also shown are two rectangles with sides parallel to the axes. One rectangle is oriented counterclockwise; its lower-left corner is at and its upper-right corner is at . The other rectangle is oriented clockwise; its lower-left corner is at and its upper-right corner is at .       Circular curve has positive circulation. Larger rectangular curve has positive circulation. Smaller rectangular curve has negative circulation.    The circular curve is oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The larger rectangular curve is either orthogonal to the vector field or oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The smaller rectangular curve is orthogonal to the vector field or has the opposite orientation. Thus, its circulation is negative.      Summary     An oriented curve is a vector-valued function of one variable where we interpret the initial and terminal values of the domain of as giving an orientation to the curve. A curve that ends at the same point where it started is said to be closed.    A line integral measures of a vector field along an oriented curve measures the extent to which the vector field points in a direction consistent with the orientation of the curve.    Line integrals have many properties that are analogous to those of definite integrals of functions of a single variable. The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation of the vector field along the curve.         The three figures below show three vector fields. In each case,  determine whether the line integral around the circle (oriented counterclockwise) is positive, negative, or zero.  Note: Use \"0\" for zero, \"P\" for positive, and \"N\" for negative.   (A)    (B)   (C)    0    0    0   The vector line integral of is the integral of the tangential component of along the curve. The positive direction of a curve is counterclockwise.   For the vector field below, the line integral around the circle is zero because the contribution of the negative tangential components from the upper part of the circle is the same as the contribution of the positive tangential components from the lower part.   The vector field below appears to take the form for some continuous functions and . As such, it is the gradiant of a function, and any integral around a closed loop is zero.   In the vector field below, the vector field is orthogonal to the unit tangent vector at each point, hence the line integral is zero.          Let C be the counter-clockwise planar circle with center at the origin and radius r 0. Without computing them, determine for the following vector fields whether the line integrals are positive, negative, or zero and type P, N, or Z as appropriate.  A. = the radial vector field = :  B. = the circulating vector field = :  C. = the circulating vector field = :  D. = the constant vector field = :    z    p    n    z         Consider the vector field shown in the figure below together with the paths , , and .   ( Note: For the vector field, vectors are shown with a dot at the tail of the vector.)  Arrange the line integrals , and in ascending order:    ?    integral on C1    integral on C2    integral on C3       ?    integral on C1    integral on C2    integral on C3       ?    integral on C1    integral on C2    integral on C3   .                  , because the curve moves from larger to smaller -values, and the vector field points from right to left. By similar logic, we note that both of and are positive. However, because has a smaller component pointing in the same direction as the vector field, the integral on is larger than that on . Applying this logic to each of the curves, we find that         Determine whether the line integral of each vector field (in blue) along the oriented path (in red) is positive, negative, or zero.           ?    Positive    Negative    Zero      ?    Positive    Negative    Zero      ?    Positive    Negative    Zero             ?    Positive    Negative    Zero      ?    Positive    Negative    Zero      ?    Positive    Negative    Zero      (Click on a graph to enlarge it)   SOLUTION  1. The line integral is zero along the vertical and horizontal segments, since the vectors are perpendicular to the segments. The vectors along the slanted segment generally point in opposite direction of the curve. Thus the line integral is negative.  2. The vectors are perpendicular to the line segments of the curve. Thus the line integral is zero .  3. The line integral along the curve in the first quadrant is counterbalanced by the line integral in the third quadrant. Similarly for the line integrals in the second and fourth quadrant. Thus the total line integral is zero.  4. Vectors with larger magnitude generally point in the opposite direction of the curve. Thus the line integral is negative .  5. The vectors are perpendicular to the circles, thus the line integral along the circles is zero. The line integrals along the orizontal and vertical segments counterbalance one another since they have opposite signs. Thus the total line integral is zero .  6. The line integral is zero along the vertical and horizontal segments, since the vectors are perpendicular to the segments. The vectors along the larger circle (with larger magnitude than the vectors along the smaller circle) generally point in same direction of the curve. Thus the line integral is positive .         Determine whether the line integral of each vector field (in blue) along the semicircular, oriented path (in red) is positive, negative, or zero.           Choose    Positive    Negative    Zero      Choose    Positive    Negative    Zero      Choose    Positive    Negative    Zero             Choose    Positive    Negative    Zero      Choose    Positive    Negative    Zero      Choose    Positive    Negative    Zero      (Click on a graph to enlarge it)   SOLUTION  1. The vectors of the radial vector field are perpendicular to the curve. Thus the line integral is zero.  2. The vector field points in the opposite direction as the curve. Thus the line integral is negative.  3. The vector field points in the same direction as the curve. Thus the line integral is positive.  4. The line integral in the first quadrant counterbalances the line integral in the second quadrant. Thus the line integral along the semicircle is zero.  5. The line integral in the first quadrant counterbalances the line integral in the second quadrant. Thus the line integral along the semicircle is zero.  6. The vectors point generally in the same direction as the curve. Thus the line integral is positive.        "

  "body": " Using Parametrizations to Calculate Line Integrals     How can we use a parametrization of an oriented curve to calculate ?    How does the parametrization chosen for an oriented curve alter the value of the line integral ?    What can be said about the line integral of a vector field along two different oriented curves when the curves have the same starting point and same ending point?      We begin this section by taking a look at how we can calculate a line integral of a vector field along some line segments and use this calculation as inspiration to see how treating oriented curves as vector-valued functions will allow us to quickly turn a line integral of a vector field into a single variable integral.    Let , let be the line segment from to , let be the line segment from to , and let be the line segment from to . Also let . This vector field and the curves are shown in .   A vector field and three oriented curves   The vector field plotted for and . This vector field radiates from the origin with vector length increasing as distance from the origin increases. The graph includes the line segment from to , the line segment from to , and the line segment from to .      Every point along has . Therefore, along , the vector field can be viewed purely as a function of . In particular, along , we have . Since every point along has the same -value, what (in terms of only) is along ?    along .    along .    Recall that , and along , we have that . Thus, . We know that along , .   Write along without using a dot product.   Along the path , .   What interval of -values describes ?     Since is the line segment from to , we have that .   Write as an integral of the form and evaluate the integral.   From the previous parts, .    Use an analogous approach to write as an integral of the form and evaluate the integral.     Along , and . Thus, we have .    Use the previous parts and a property of line integrals to calculate without having to evaluate any additional integrals.     Evaluating takes more work at this stage, so let's break the process into smaller pieces.   Find the slope-intercept ( ) form of the equation of the line cnotaining the line segment .   The slope is . Using this with either point gives , so the slope-intercept form of the line's equation is .   Just as we noticed that along we always had , we now know how to express in terms of for all points along . Use this to to express as a vector purely in terms of for the points along .   along .   We know that along , . Thus, along .   We often think of the slope of a line as being . Use this fact and the slope of the line cnotaining to express as a multiple of .    Since the line's slope is , we have , which implies that   We may view as . Since and , write as a vector in terms of . You should be able to factor out from your result and write your answer in the form .          Use the range of -values covered by the line segment to write as a single-variable integral of the form and evaluate the integral.       From the coordinates of its endpoints, we know that has . Combining the previous parts, we obtain .    Notice that and both start at and end at . How do the values of and compare?   Different values.   The results of the calculations for and are different.    Is a gradient vector field? Why or why not?   What would tell you about a potential function such that ?   No.   The vector field is not a gradient vector field because there is no scalar-valued function of two variables such that and . According to Clairaut's Theorem, if such a function existed, then , but .      Parametrizations in the Definition of   has shown us that it is possible to evaluate line integrals without needing to resort to working with Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line segments. It was not critical that the paths in were straight lines, but rather that the paths had a description where both and could be expressed in terms of one variable. Fortunately, parametrizing the oriented curve along which a line integral is calculated provides a powerful tool for evaluating line integrals.  Suppose that is an oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function for , and let be a cnotinuous vector field defined on a region cnotaining . We can divide the interval into sub-intervals, each of length , by letting for . This subdivision of then can be used to break up into pieces by letting for as we did in . Now notice that .   Looking at the definition of the line integral and substituting this new expression for gives . When evaluating the limit as , the expression in the parentheses will is . We then have a Riemann sum that reduces the evaluation of a line integral of a vector-valued function along an oriented curve to a definite integral of a function of one variable. Note that after evaluating the dot product, is (scalar) function of . We restate this result below for easy reference.    Let be a smooth, oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function for . If is a cnotinuous vector field defined near , then .      Let and let be the quarter of the circle of radius from to . This vector field and curve are shown in . By properties of line integrals, we know that , and we will use this property since is the usual clockwise orientation of a circle, meaning we can parametrize by for .   The vector field and an oriented curve    The region in the -plane with and . The quarter circle of radius centered at the origin and oriented clockwise is shown along with the vector field , which cnotains vectors whose magnitudes increase more as increases than as increases. Also vectors farther from the -axis have steeper positive slope than those close to the -axis, which are close to horiznotal.    To evaluate using this parametrization, we need to note that .  Thus, we have .    As the example above shows, allows us to reduce the problem of calculating a line integral of a vector-valued function along an oriented curve to one of finding a suitable parametrization for the curve. Once we have such a parametrization, evaluating the line integral becomes evaluating a single-variable integral, which is something you have done many times before. The example also illustrates that using the properties of line integrals can allow us to use a more natural parametrization. You may find it interesting to use the parametrization for to evaluate the line integral. Do you get the same result?    Find the work done by the vector field on a particle that moves from the point to the point along the helix given by .     for , so , so and   Let . Let be the closed curve consisting of the top half of the circle of radius centered at the origin and the portion of the -axis from to , oriented clockwise. Find the circulation of around .   Let be given by where . This means that and .  Let be given by where . This means that and .  Thus the line integral over then will give a result of .    The next activity has you investigate the line integrals of a fixed vector field along different curves. This will be an important, recurring theme as we study a variety of different integrals and vector fields in this chapter.   Let .    Let be the portion of the graph of from to . Calculate .   If and the curve is traced out by for , then   Let be the line segment from to . Calculate .  In this part, the curve is traced out by for . So     Let be the circle of radius centered at the origin, oriented counterclockwise. Calculate .   In this part, the curve is traced out by as . So     To connect the previous parts of this activity, use a graphing utility to plot the curves and on the same axes.   What type of curve is ?   Closed   Since the curves have the same endpoints but is oriented oppositely, forms a closed curve.   What is the value of ?     Since , we have that .   What does your answer to part allow you to say about the value of the line integral of along the top half of compared to the line integral of from to along the bottom half of the circle of radius centered at the origin?  They are equal.  If we reverse the orientation of the bottom half, these curves combine to form . Thus, the sum of the two line integrals is , and so when changing the orientation of the bottom portion of the circle, we get that the line integrals are equal.      Alternative Notation for Line Integrals  In cnotexts where the fact that the quantity we are measuring via a line integral is best measured via a dot product (such as calculating work), the notation we have used thus far for line integrals is fairly common. However, sometimes the vector field is such that the units on , , and are not distances. In this case, a dot product may not have a physical meaning, and an alternative notation using differentials can be common. Specifically, if , then . A line integral in the form of is called the differential form of a line integral line integral differential form of .  (If is a vector field in , the term is omitted.) As a concrete example, if and is some oriented curve in , then .  It is important to recognize that the integral on the right-hand side is still a line integral and must be evaluated using techniques for evaluating line integrals. We cannot simply try to treat it as if it were a definite integral of a function of one variable. Because the notation provides a reminder that this is a line integral and not a definite integral of the types calculated earlier in your study of calculus, we will only use the vector notation for line integrals in the body of the text. However, some exercises may require use of the differential form.    Independence of Parametrization for a Fixed Curve  Up to this point, we have chosen whatever parametrization of an oriented curve came to mind, and our argument for how we can use parametrizations to calculate line integrals did not depend on the specific choice of parametrization. However, it is not immediately obvious that different parametrizations don't result in different values of the line integral. Our next example explores this question.   Let . We consider two different oriented curves from to . The first oriented curve travels horiznotally to and then proceeds vertically to . The second oriented curve is the line segment from to . Notice that, as depicted in , we can break up into two oriented curves (the horiznotal portion) and (the vertical portion) so that .   The vector field and some oriented curves.   The vector field , which consists of horiznotal vectors that increase in length as distance from the -axis increases. Three oriented line segments are also depicted. The line segment is from to . The line segment is from to . The line segment is from to .     We first note that since is orthogonal to , ; therefore . We can parametrize as for ( is treated like the coordinate ), which leads to .  Thus, .  Now we look at , but we parametrize in a nonstandard way by letting for . (You should use a graphing utility to plot this parametrization to help convince yourself that it really does give .) This gives , and   In the next activity, you are asked to consider the more typical parametrization of and verify that using it gives the same value for the line integral.  It's also worth observing here that , so at least two (very different) paths from to give the same value of the line integral here. The next section will further investigate when line integrals over different paths (with the same initial point and final point) will evaluate to the same value.   As promised, the final activity of this section asks you to look at another parametrization of the curve from the previous example. It also asks you to look at two different oriented curves between a pair of points, similarly to what you did in .    The typical parametrization of the line segment from to (the oriented curve in ) is where . Use this parametrization to calculate for the vector field and compare your answer to the result of .   Using the parametrization given the line integral becomes This is the same result as in .    Calculate where is the oriented curve consisting of the line segment from the origin to followed by the line segment from to .   Let where and where . Our line integral can be computed with  Thus the line integral over then is     Calculate where is the line segment from to .   The line segment from to can be given by with . Note that , so     Is the vector field you considered in the previous two parts a gradient vector field? Why or why not? How does this compare to the vector field of ?  No  No. One way to observe this would be to check the partial derivative with respect to of the component and compare it to the partial derivative with respect to of the component. Since they are not equal, tells us that this vector field is not a gradient vector field.    Although we have not given a proof or even an intuitive argument, the phenomenon you observed in part of is not particular to this curve or this vector field. The value of does not depend on the parametrization of used to calculate the line integral when using . We will take this for granted in the remainder of the chapter. The next section will engage in a serious exploration of when a vector field has the property that the line integral from a point to a point does not depend not he choice of oriented path between them.    Summary     Line integrals of vector fields along oriented curves can be evaluated by parametrizing the curve in terms of and then calculating the integral of on the interval .    The parametrization chosen for an oriented curve when calculating the line integral using the formula does not impact the value of the line integral.

Philosophically, the Riemann sum in is adding up the scalar function given by the dot product of the vector field and the unit vector in the direction of travel (along the curve).  The following questions ask how much we can generalize the ideas of the previous sections and we will devote the rest of this section to answering these as fully as possible.    How can we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a curve in space?  What would that accumulation measure?  What is the most efficent way to calculate this?      In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called Copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amoung of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine. The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.   A plot of land with density of Copium deposits      Estimate the amount of Copium that would be mined from driving along the left side of plot.

You should also explain how and why your answer to this question is different or similar to the previous task.   A plot of land with Copium Density and a path plotted in blue     multiplied the density by the length to get the amount   Write out a longer description?      Defining line integrals of scalar functions  In , you approximated the distance traveled for various paths and multiplied by the density of the Copium on each piece of the path. In contrast to the line integral of a vector field, the calculations of the ore mined does not depend on what direction the path was traveled. We will now use these same ideas to give precise meaning to the measurement of the acculumation of a scalar function's output over a path in space.  Let be a contiunuous function of , , and for some open set around , a curve from a point to a point . We will begin to approximate the acculumlation of the output of over by breaking into pieces with boundary points . (need to replicate fig_12_2_curve_vec_field.svg without the vector field part of the plot.)  We can approximate the accumulation of over with the following sum: where is the output of for some . As this sum is made with more pieces and all of the lengths of the pieces goes to zero (i.e. ), we would expect that the sum will approach the actual acculumation of over . Notice that it won't matter how we select the point that used in each piece to evaluate the output of since evaluating the limit as the pieces gets smaller will ensure that the output value will be within a shrinking error from the average value on each piece. Evaluating the limit as the size of all of the pieces goes to zero will transform our Riemann sum into an integral that will measure the accumulation of the output of over .   The Line Integral of a Scalar Function   Let be a contiunuous function of , , and for some open set around , a curve from a point to a point in space. The line integral of over is defined as where are points such that and as the distance between and goes to zero.  The integral is called the scalar line integral of over the curve .     The notation for a scalar line integral ( ) may not immediately make sense. As with the other types of integration we have done (double integrals, line integrals of vector fields, single variable integration, etc.), the subscript of the integral symbol denotes the region of integration. In the case of a scalar line integral, the region of integration is a collection of points given by a curve in space. The function we are integrating is , a scalar valued funciton of multiple variables. The differential probably looks suspicious to you. If you remember from , is the arc length of a curve in space. So the differential in the scalar line integral notation means that we are adding up the output of over steps in arc length. This should make sense in terms of how we set up our Riemann sums. We did not set up the pieces of our curve as steps in , , or , but rather as steps in arc length (estimated by ).    In this activity, we will be making sense of scalar line integrals by examining a few common functions and justifying whether the scalar line integrals given are positive, negative, or zero. Let the functions , , , and be defined as                  For each of the paths given below, sketch (in either 2D or 3D) the curve and label at least three points on the curve including the end points (if they exist).   is the part of the unit circle (in the -plane centered at the origin) that is above the line    is the part of the unit circle (on the plane centered at the origin) with    is the part of the helix given by with      answers go here   Write out a longer description?

Using Parameterizations to Calculate Scalar Line Integrals   defined in terms of a limit of a Riemann sum which is usually very useful for understanding what is being measured and not very useful when it comes to efficiently calculating the value of a given integral. A scalar line integral is presented algebraically in terms of three variables because the curve is given in terms of points in three coordinates and the function to be integrated is dependent on those same coordinate values. Geometrically, the scalar line integral is a one dimensional problem because we only have one dimension to travel; namely we can travel along the curve (in steps of arc length). Remember that a parameterization of a curve in space is a description of how to travel through the , , and points of the curve in terms of a parameter (usually given as .) Parameterizations are very useful converting the three-variable algebra of a scalar line integral problem into a one dimensional integral.  Let's look at again where we have a parameterization for given by a vector valued function of one variable for in some interval . Instead of thinking in terms of pieces of the curve , the parameterization allows us to break the interval into pieces where and . While these pieces will be equally spaced in terms of the parameter , the corresponding points on the curve given by will not be equally spaced. We can simplify the notation of our function evaluation as follows: where . Remember that the parameterization will allow us to write all parts of the scalar line integral as a function of , so we will simplify as follows: Applying our parameterization and corresponding points to Definition will give the following This is the Riemann Sum of a scalar function of , specifically where ( is the speed of the parameterization ).   Calculating Scalar Line Integrals with Parameterizations  Let be a continuous multivariable function around a curve in space , where has a parameterization given by for .     Let us return to some of the problems from . Specifically, let be part of the unit circle on the -plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by . We will also consider . We can parameterize by with . Note here that . We can rewrite the output of along using the parameterization as . Applying , we get   This result should make sense from your earlier explainations of . Specifically, we can break the line integral of into three parts according to the following plot.   A subdivided plot of    The scalar line integal on the blue and the red paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric and the output of will be opposite in sign on the blue and red. This means that will be the same as the line integral of on the green path. Since the output of is positive on the green path, our result for the scalar line integral should be positive.    Let be part of the unit circle on the -plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by . We will also consider . We can parameterize by with . Note here that . We can rewrite the output of along using the parameterization as . Applying , we get   This result should make sense from your earlier explainations of Task . Specifically, we can break the line integral of into three parts according to the following plot.   A subdivided plot of    The scalar line integal on the blue and the red paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric and the output of will be opposite in sign on the blue and red. Thus the line integral of over will be zero.     Properties and Visualizations of Scalar Line Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation. If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of definite integrals.   Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , scalar valued functions and , and oriented curves , , and , the following properties hold:                          Explaining Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals   In this activity, we will be explaining each of the Properties from in the context of our Copium mining analogy from . Remember that the curve in our scalar line integral cooresponds to the path the mining rig will take and the function in the scalar line integral measures the density of Copium at that point on the surface.    Explain in your own words what means in the Copium analogy and what exactly would be measured by this scalar line integral.   The scalar line integral would calculate the accumulation of Copium mined along the path given by where gives the density of Copium at each location in the area. In particular, measures the total Copium mined along the path .   The scalar line integral would calculate the accumulation of Copium mined along the path given by where gives the density of Copium at each location in the area. In particular, measures the total Copium mined along the path .   Explain in your own words what means in the Copium analogy.

It may be helpful to describe each side of the equation separately and say why they are equal in the analogy.   We will spend the last part of this section talking about a way to try to visualize the scalar line integral as an area under a curve (in the same way that we visualized 1D integrals.) Let's return to our Copium analogy from . In particular, we can look the left side of the mining area.   A plot of land with density of Copium deposits    In particular, we could visualize the linear density of Copium along the left side of the area using a plot like Figure .   A plot of the Copium density on the left side of the mine shown above    In , the horizontal axis gives the distance traveled along the left side of . Because this is a stright path, we could plot the density above the path of the Copium mining plot. In fact, we could plot the density above the plot for all of the sides of the mining plot.   A three-dimensional plot of the Copium Density plotted for the edges of the mining area     shows the Copium Mine plot (in gray) and the paths that are the boundary of the plot in red. The curve in green shows the Copium Density at each point on the boundary of the mine plot. The area in yellow would be the scalar line integral for the path that is the boundary of the mine plot. In particular, the area in yellow would give the total Copium mined from driving our mining machine around the boundary of the mine plot.  Because the curve we are looking at in involves straight lines and simple heights, there is no confusion when looking at this plot and using an area under the curve analogy. What if we looked at the scalar line integral of a function like along the helix given below?   A three-dimensional plot of a helix    You can already see part of the problem involved here since if we used the -coordinate to plot the output of our scalar function, then our area might intersect other parts of the curve. The plot below shows the confused plot we would have if we looked at as the height above our curve in blue.   A three-dimensional plot of a helix with height given by        Find the line integral with respect to arc length , where is the line segment in the -plane with endpoints and .

In , , and , we have encountered situations where and are different oriented curves from a point to a point and . In this section, we explore vector fields which have the property that for all points and , if and are oriented paths from to , then .

In other words, what is the difference in the output of at the start of the curve and the end of the curve. How does this value compare to the value of the line integral you found in ?   Algebraically, . There is no net change in the output of . The line integral is also .    Let be the line segment from to . Calculate as well as . What do you notice?   The line segment is given by as . Thus, Note here that which is the same as the result of the line integral.    Earlier in the chapter, we've used to argue that a vector field in is not a gradient vector field when . Earlier in this preview activity, you verified that a given vector field was the gradient of a particular function of two variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of three variables. However, in that case there are six mixed partials to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious.The remaining parts of this preview activity suggest a process for determining if a vector field in is a gradient vector field as well as finding a potential function for the vector field.  Let and .  If and are to be gradient vector fields, then there are functions and for which and . What would this tell us about the partial derivatives , , , , , and ?

Find a function so that .   and     and     When finding the most general anti-derivative for a function of one variable, we add a constant of integration (usually denoted by ) to capture the fact that any constant will become through differentiation.   When taking the partial derivative with respect to of a function of , , and , what variables can appear in terms that become in the partial derivative because they are treated as constants?  and  Any terms that do not contain an -variable will be treated as a constant, so and are allowed.

Path-Independent Vector Fields  We say that a vector field defined on a domain is path-independent  pathindependent definition if whenever and are oriented paths in such that both curves start at the same point and end at point .  In and , we encountered situations where we had evidence that a vector field was path-independent. However, since the definition of path-independence requires that the value of the line integral be the same for every pair of points in the domain and every possible path from one point to the other, it doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent is an easy task.  Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be shown to be path-independent. Let be a function for which is continuous on a domain . Suppose that and are points in and let be a smooth oriented path from to . Let's take a look at by fixing an arbitrary parametrization of , . Since , we know that   If , then the integrand above is   Notice that this is exactly what the chain rule tells us is equal to. Therefore, .  In other words, gradient vector fields are path-independent vector fields, and we can evaluate line integrals of gradient vector fields by using a potential function. (Technically the argument above assumed that was smooth, but we can replace by a piecewise smooth curve by splitting the line integral up into the sum of finitely many line integrals along smooth curves.)  This result is so important that it is frequently called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, because of its similarity to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which can be written as .   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals   Let be a function for which is continuous on a domain . If and are points in and is a piece-wise smooth oriented path from to in , then .

We can choose and note that . so by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, .     Line Integrals Along Closed Curves  Recall that we call an oriented curve  closed if it has the same initial and terminal point. A typical example of a closed curve would be a circle (with an orientation of which way to go around), but we could also consider something like the square with vertices , , , and , oriented clockwise (or counterclockwise). Recall that we sometimes use the symbol for a line integral when the curve is closed and that if , then .    Suppose that is a continuous path-independent vector field (in or ) on some domain .    Let and be points in and let and be oriented curves from to . What can you say about and ?  . Because is a path-independent vector field and both and start at and end at , .   Let . Explain why is a closed curve.   starts and ends at .   The curve is closed because the end of is the start of and the end of is the start of , thus starts and ends at .    Calculate .  and by part 1, this difference is zero.   Write a sentence that summarizes what we can conclude at this point in the activity.   The line integral along every closed curve in a path-independent vector field is .    Now let us suppose that is a continuous vector field on a domain for which for all closed curves . Pick two points and in . Let and be oriented curves from to . What type of curve is ?  Closed We have that is a closed curve (from to ) because will go from to and will go from back to .   What is ? Why?  We see that because (as stated above) is a continuous vector field on a domain for which for all closed curves .   What does that tell you about the relationship between and ?  Since , .   Explain why this shows that is path-independent.  Arbitrary paths with common initial and terminal points were used. The argument above relies only on the fact that the two paths have the same initial and terminal points.   We summarize the result of with the theorem below. Although this theorem is not a terribly useful way to show that a vector field is path-independent, it can be a useful way to show that a vector field is not path-independent: find a closed curve around which the circulation is not zero.    Let be a continuous vector field on a domain . Suppose that is a closed curve in . The circulation of along , given by , is zero if and only if is path-independent.    The following activity gives you a chance to reason about path-independence based purely on a graphical representation of a vector field.    Explain why neither of the vector fields in is path-independent.   Two vector fields that are not path-independent.      A vector field in which all vectors are horizontal. The vectors are along the -axis, point to the right for and point to the left for . Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases.       A vector field in which vectors appear to circulate in a clockwise manner around the point . The magnitude of vectors increases with the distance from . The plot shows the portion of the vector field with and .        For , consider a square with lower-left corner and upper-right corner . For , consider a circle centered at .    In , we consider the square with lower-left corner and upper-right corner , oriented clockwise, to be . Notice that because the line integrals along the horizontal edges of the square are both positive and the line integrals along the vertical sides are zero because is orthogonal to those sides. Because the line integral along this closed curve is not , is not path-independent.  In , consider the circle of radius centered at the point . It appears that is tangent to , but we can confidently say that along , which makes , and thus is not path-independent.      What other vector fields are path-independent?  Recall that in single variable calculus, the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that given a constant and a continuous function , there is a unique function for which and . In particular, is this function. We are about to investigate an analog of this result for path-independent vector fields, but first we require two additional definitions.  If is a subset of or , we say that is open  open definition provided that for every point in , there is a disc (in ) or ball (in ) centered at that point such that every point of the disc\/ball is contained in . For example, the set of points in for which is open, since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc contained in the set. However, if we change the inequality to , then the set is not open, as any point on the circle cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside the set, that is with . We will also say that a region is path-connected path-connected definition provided that for every pair of points in , there is a path from one to the other contained in .     Let be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, connected region . We will assume that is in and is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to . We want to define a function on by using the vector field and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign an arbitrary value. (Setting is probably convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point in , define , where is any oriented path from to . Since is connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since is path-independent, is well-defined. If different paths from to gave different values for the line integral, then we'd not be sure what really is.  To better understand this mysterious function we've now defined, let's start looking at its partial derivatives.    Since is open, there is a disc (perhaps very small) surrounding that is contained in , so fix a point in that disc. Since is path-connected, there is a path from to . Let be the line segment from to and let be the line segment from to . (See Figure .) Rewrite as a sum of and line integrals along , , and .   Two piecewise smooth oriented curves from to .   Two oriented curves from to . Both begin with a curved arc from to . The curve on the left proceeds vertically from to and then horizontally to . The curve on the right proceeds horizontally from to and then vertically to .    Because , we have that .   Notice that we can parametrize by for . Find a similar parametrization for .   for The curve can be given by for , since only the -coordinate of points on varies.   Use the parametrization from above to write and as single variable integrals in the manner of . Use the fact that to express your integrals in terms of and without any dot products.   and   Using the parametrization of and from the previous part, we notice that has only one nonzero component in each case. Thus, we have and .    Rewrite your expression for using the single variable integrals above (and a line integral along ).      Combining the previous parts, we have .    Notice that your expression for from the previous part only depends on as the upper limit of an single variable integral. Use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to calculate .   The first three terms in our expression for do not depend on , and thus when taking the partial derivative with respect to , they vanish. By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (treating as constants), . Therefore, .    To calculate , we continue to consider a path from to , but now let be the line segment from to and let be the line segment from to . Modify the process you used to find to find .   Proceeding as above, we find that . Only the last term of this expression depends on , so the first three terms vanish when calculating . By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, . Therefore, .    What can you conclude about the relationship between and ? What does this tell you about beyond that it is path-independent and continuous?  ; is a gradient vector field  Since and , we can conclude that . Therefore, we know that is a gradient vector field.    We summarize the result of below.   Path-Independent Vector Fields  If is a path-independent vector field on an open, path-connected domain , then is a gradient vector field on . Furthermore, if is a point in and is fixed, then for a point in and an oriented curve from to in , the function is a potential function for .      Summary    Gradient vector fields are path-independent, and if is an oriented curve from to , then with the analogous result holding if is a function of three variables.    A vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is .    If a vector field is path-independent, then there exists a function such that . That is, is a conservative or gradient vector field.            For each of the following line integrals:  Determine if the applies.  If the applies, then find the potential function and use this to evaluate the line integral  If the does not apply, then describe where the process laid out in fails.     The line integral of along the helix of radius of 3 given by as .  Does not apply because of -component. The does not apply to this problem because the vector field is not a gradient vector field. The process described in the Preview Activity breaks down in the -component because there is not a term of the form .  The line integral of along the line segment from to .  The does apply to this problem because the vector field is a gradient vector field. The potential functions are of the form . Hence, the line integral evaluates as . The integral where is the parabolic path along from to . The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals does apply to this problem because the vector field is a gradient vector field. The potential functions are of the form . Hence, the line integral evaluates as .  Let , where and .   Give a component function such that is a gradient vector field.  Based on the and component functions of , the potential function will need to be of the form . This means that any of the form (where is an integrable function of ) will make a gradient vector field.  Give a component function such that is not a gradient vector field.  Based on the and component functions of , the potential function will need to be of the form . This means that any that is not of the form (where is an integrable function of ) will prevent from being a conservative vector field.   This exercise focuses on reasoning graphically about line integrals and vector fields.   Find a closed curve on which the line integral of the vector field pictured below will not be zero. Be sure to clearly define your curve and explain why the line integral over your curve is non-zero.   A vector field   A vector field showing counterclockwise rotation around the origin. At the origin, the vector field is zero, and vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases.    The path of line segments from to to to .   Using the path of line segments from to to to , you can see the only part of the path where the vector field is not orthogonal to the path is from to . On the segment to the vector field will have a strictly positive dot product with the direction of travel and the line integral over the segment to will necessarily be positive.   A vector field showing counterclockwise rotation around the origin. At the origin, the vector field is zero, and vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases. Also shown is the counterclockwise-oriented triangle with vertices , , and .    Explain why you think the following vector field is path independent or not.   Another vector field   A vector field in which vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases. Vectors are oriented as if they follow hyperbolas with asymptotes and . Vectors above both asymptotes or below both asymptotes result in counterclockwise rotation. The other vectors result in clockwise rotation.

  "body": " The Divergence of a Vector Field     How can you measure where a vector field is created (or destroyed)?    How can you measure where a vector field's strength is increasing or decreasing?    What does the divergence of a vector field measure and how can you visually estimate whether the divergence of a vector field is positive or negative?      As we saw in , there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is Where exactly is the vector field created? With the vector field in , imagine sketching a curve that follows the direction of the vector field by treating the vectors in the vector field as tangent vectors to your curve. No matter where you start, you should observe that the vector field decreases in strength as you move along the flow. We wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.   A vector field with changing strength   A vector field with vectors shortest along the line and longer as distance from that line increases. Vectors in the fourth quadrant point primarily in the positive -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the second quadrant point primarily in the negative -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the first and third quadrants exhibit a form of counterclockwise rotation.      In this preview activity, we will look at several two-dimensional vector fields and try to assess when the vector field has increased or decreased in strength over a given region. We begin with graphs of the three vector fields. Parts , , and ask you to answer the same three questions about the vector field and square illustrated in each of the figures. Part asks you to think further about the third vector field.   Vector Field   A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin. The length of vectors increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .     Vector Field   A vector field with vectors below the -axis pointing primarily up near the axis and primarily to the right farther away from the axis. Above the -axis, vectors point primarily to the right. Vector magnitudes are shortest near the positive -axis. There is a square in the second quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .     Vector Field   A vector field in which vectors circulate around the origin as if tangent vectors to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled . There is a point labeled in the second quadrant that is the reflection of across the -axis. In the third quadrant, there is a point that is closer to the -axis than to the -axis. In the fourth quadrant, there is a point labeled that appears to be on the line but is farther from the origin than or .      For each of the vector fields , , and and the square centered on the corresponding point for , which statement do you think best applies?  More of the vector field is going into the square than going out.  Less of the vector field is going into the square than going out.  The same amount of the vector field is going into the square as is going out.      For each of the vector fields , , and (and corresponding square), does your answer to part suggest that the vector field is being created, destroyed, or is unchanging in strength inside the square? Explain your reasoning.    Would the answer to parts or change if you used a smaller square centered on for any of the vector fields and points with ? Explain your reasoning.    Thinking now only about the vector field , would your answers to parts , , or change if you considered squares around points , , or ? Explain your reasoning.      Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field  In this section, we will go through the process for how to measure the density of the creation or destruction of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point. Next, using a limit, we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because our vector fields will change in a continuous fashion, we won't have the vector field actually change at a single point. Rather, we will really be measuring the density for the change in strength of the vector field.  We will develop all of our measurements in a two dimensional setting for now. However, our arguments can be applied to three (or more) dimensions. We start in the same fashion as in . Namely, we will look at how much of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered at a point . For this development, we will consider a two-dimensional vector field given by .   A square around the point   A square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and centered at the point . The upper-right corner of the square is labeled .    We can parametrize the top edge of the box (in blue) by with . Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized by , , and with .  The amount of the vector field that is created inside the square around the point can be measured by the net amount of the vector field coming in or going out of the square. The amount of vector flow that goes through each of the boundary segments can be measured by looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field on each particular segment. For instance, on the top segment (in blue), the vertical component determines how much of the vector field goes in or out of the square. Integrating just the vertical component of the vector field over the points on the top segment of our square will therefore measure how much of the vector field goes through the top of the square.  The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square (in orange). Similarly, if we want to measure how much of goes through either the left or right side of the square, we need to integrate the horizontal component . Hence, the net flow of the vector field into or out of the square will be given by  Notice that some of the integrals are subtracted because we need to pay attention to the orientation of the vector field relative to the square. A positive vertical component of the vector field ( ) will correspond to flow out on the top of the square but will correspond to the vector field flowing into the square on the bottom. So in the integrals above, we are counting the flow out of the square as positive and the flow in as negative.  We are measuring the net flow through the square as a scalar quantity. We can look at what happens to our scalar quantity as we shrink the square to the point by decreasing . In order for this to make the most sense, we will change our measurement to be a density argument by calculating flow in (or out) per unit area. This will allow us to compare our net flow calculations across squares with different areas. In other words, we want to consider what happens to as goes to zero.  We will take a moment here before we apply our limit to simplify our integrals in order to make the limit easier to evaluate. In particular, we will apply the Mean Value Theorem to each of four the integrals above. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to the first integral gives , where is some value in the interval . Applying the Mean Value Theorem to each of the other integrals yields , where are values in and are values in . Thus our flow density can be measured by looking at the limit as of the net flow (in or out) over the square divided by the area of the square.   To simplify the limit further, we will reorganize our limit expression. Specifically, we collect the and terms separately. This gives Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from Section 1.5.2 and notice that as , the numbers must go to and must go to . Therefore, after evaluating our limit, the flow density is .  While this simplification may seem a bit amazing and magical, our conceptual steps should help us make sense of the result. If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. How the horizontal component changes over small steps in the vertical direction will give us information about how the direction of the vector field changes but not how the strength of the vector field is changing.  The arguments we made about measuring how much of the vector field flows into or out of a square has straightforward generalization to three (or more) dimensions. However, doing so requires a method for measuring how much of a vector field flows through a surface. This will be the subject of .    Definition of the Divergence of a Vector Field  In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of the flow density at a point as giving a measurement of the how the strength of the vector field changes by using a density argument. The standard name for this quantity is the divergence of a vector field, which we now formally define.    The divergence of a vector field  is given by In three dimensions, the divergence of the vector field is given by      Alternative Notation for Divergence  In other sources you may see the divergence written using a dot product as . This notation is very compact and works well with the understanding that the del operator is a function that operates on other functions. However, this notation can also be confusing because of its emphasis on computation rather than conceptual understanding. In this text, we will not generally write the divergence using the del operator.   Another way to see divergence on a vector field plot is to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector field, then the divergence is zero. Also, remember that the divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and will change depending on location. The next activity asks you to graphically examine the divergence of three vector fields.   Graphical Representations of Divergence   For this part of the activity, consider the vector field shown in .   Vector field   A vector field with vectors pointing toward the origin. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases.     Draw a circle in the first quadrant of the vector field depicted in . Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of the circle, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in the first quadrant?   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the first quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude?   Draw a circle in quadrants II, II, and IV. Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of your circles, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in quadrants II, II, and IV?   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the third quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude.   Based on your arguments above, describe why the divergence of is negative for all points in the -plane.    Look at the plot of the vector field in and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane. You may need to make separate arguments for each of the four quadrants.   Vector field   A vector field in which vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases. Vectors are oriented as if they follow hyperbolas with asymptotes and . Vectors above both asymptotes or below both asymptotes result in counterclockwise rotation. The other vectors result in clockwise rotation.      Look at the plot of the vector field in below and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane. You may need to make separate arguments for each of the four quadrants.   Vector field    A vector field having longer vectors where . For , vectors appear to get longer as distance from the -axis increases.      The final activity of this section asks you to do some algebraic calculations of divergence using .    Calculate the divergence of the vector fields given below.            Explain how your answers to the questions in can be explained by using your results from part of this activity.

  "body": " The Curl of a Vector Field     What is meant by rotation of a vector field in a plane?    How can a two-dimensional measurement of rotation be generalized to work in three dimensions?    How can the rotational strength of a vector field be measured?      In , we examined how the strength of a vector field in two (or more) dimensions changed in different regions. In particular, we developed the divergence of a vector field as a local (or density) measurement for how the strength of the vector field changes. The key ideas when interpreting divergence are:  A positive divergence means that the vector field is growing in strength.  A negative divergence means that the vector field is decreasing in strength.  A zero divergence means that the vector field is not changing in strength.    In many physical settings, it is also useful to measure the rotational strength of a vector field at a local scale. For instance, the vector field on the left of Figure shows a vector field which flows in a counterclockwise fashion around the origin. The vector field on the right of Figure shows a vector field which does not have a rotational aspect to its flow.   Examples of vector fields with global rotation properties (left) and without rotation in either the global or local sense (right)    A vector field exhibiting counterclockwise rotation around the origin. Vectors appear to be tangent to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.    A vector field with all vectors pointing toward the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.     These global ideas of rotation are nice, but are not always visually apparent or may only appear in some regions. For instance, the vector field on the left of seems to have rotation around at least a couple of different points. In each quadrant, the vector field on the right of has different rotational patterns.   Examples of vector fields with varying rotation properties    A vector field having longer vectors where . For , vectors appear to get longer as distance from the -axis increases.    A vector field with vectors shortest along the line and longer as distance from that line increases. Vectors in the fourth quadrant point primarily in the positive -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the second quadrant point primarily in the negative -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the first and third quadrants exhibit a form of counterclockwise rotation.       We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of spinner we imagine is illustrated in . It consists of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner's paddle.   A picture of our model spinner   A spinner consisting of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis.      To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field in . As you think about these questions, draw an X at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.   The vector field   A vector field exhibiting counterclockwise rotation around the origin. Vectors appear to be tangent to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.     Draw a vector on the top right blade of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade. Next, draw a vector on each of the other blades of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade.   Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at the origin would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.   Now we would like to look at the rotational strength of at the point . As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade. It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.   Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all. You should pay attention to which blades will have a stronger force (in comparison to the blade on the other side).   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all? Draw a representation of a spinner if necessary to demonstrate your ideas.   Are there any points on the -plane where the spinner would not turn counterclockwise?    For this part, look at the vector field in .   A vector field   A vector field with all vectors pointing away from the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.     Would a small spinner placed at the origin spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Are there any points in the -plane where the spinner would turn differently than your descriptions in the previous part of this problem?    For this part, we consider the vector field shown in .   The vector field   A vector field consisting of identical vectors. Each vector points up and to the right. The vertical component of the vectors is greater than the horizontal component.     Would a small spinner placed at the origin spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Are there any points on the -plane where the spinner would turn differently than your descriptions in the previous part of this problem?    For this part, look at the vector field in . You may find it useful to recenter the plot on your point by changing and . You may also zoom in on your point by using the slider labeled zoom .    A SageMath Interact to examine vector fields      Would a small spinner placed at the origin spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all?   For each of the following spinner behaviors, give a point in the -plane (different than the ones used in the previous parts) where a spinner would:  Turn clockwise.  Turn counterclockwise.  Not turn at all.        Measuring the Circulation Density of Vector Field in  In this subsection, we will develop the measurement of the circulation density for a two-dimensional vector field. We will use this measurement to generalize to a notion of rotational strength in higher dimensional cases in the next subsection.  We will start by measuring the circulation of a vector field on a path around the point and use this measurement to define circulation density. Specifically, we will measure the circulation of a vector field as we move around a square centered at . Using this measurement, we will calculate the circulation density by dividing our measurement by the area enclosed. This will allow us to compare our measurement across regions of different sizes. By taking the limit of this circulation density as the square's side length goes to zero, we will have the circulation density at the point . Just as in our discussion of , we will look at a two dimensional setting first, then examine how our argument can be generalized to higher dimensions.  Let's start by measuring the circulation around a square with side length centered at a point . Namely, we will look at the line integral of our vector field as we move along the square curve shown in .   A square centered at the point with side lengths traveled counterclockwise   A square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The center of the square is at the point . The upper right corner of the square is labeled . Each edge of the square is oriented so that the overall orientation around the square is counterclockwise.    We can parametrize the top edge of the square using the parametrization for . Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized (over the same range of values for ) as follows:   In order to measure the circulation, we want to know how much of the vector field is parallel to the direction of travel. Thus, along each of the sides of the box, we only need to look at one of the components of the vector field. The only contribution to the circulation on the top and bottom comes from the horizontal component . Similarly, the vertical component is all that contributes on the right and left sides. This means that we can simplify our line integrals considerably once we apply . For instance, the circulation on the top can be written as Similarly, we can simplify the appropriate line integrals on the other sides (ordered below as top, left, bottom, right) to get the total circulation around the square to be Note that the sign on the top and the left sides ends up being switched because the direction of travel on these sides is in the negative coordinate direction. It is important to note that by convention, we talk about positive rotation being counterclockwise and negative rotation being clockwise when looking at these planar graphs. This will be discussed more fully in .  As with our development of divergence, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to the four integrals above to simplify future calculations. Specifically, the Mean Value Theorem applied to the first integral tells us that there is a value to get a value in the interval such that Applying the same arguments to the other three integrals in our Total Circulation calculation gives Here we have and . We can regroup these terms to get the following expression for the total circulation around our square:   A larger square is likely to have a larger total circulation since there is more distance to accumulate how much the vector field is moving in the same direction as our path. This is noticeable in the formula above for total circulation, as the side length of the square appears in the formula. In order to compare our rotational or circulation ideas over different sizes of squares, we will now look at the circulation density (strength of rotation per unit area), which can be computed directly from our total circulation measurement. We can take the limit of the circulation density as we shrink the square to the central point and get a measurement rotational strength of our vector field at a point.  We will compute our circulation density as . Since the area of the square is , this gives us that the circulation density is . Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from Section 1.5.2 and notice that as , must go to and must go to . Therefore, our circulation density measurement at a point is   You may have noticed that this argument had a similar flow to the development of divergence in Section . However, the result here is different because the property of the vector field we were trying to measure was different. Because divergence was developed to measure the change in the strength of the vector field (without regard to the direction), divergence is computed using the partial derivatives of the horizontal component of the vector field with respect to the horizontal variable and the vertical component of the vector field with respect to the vertical variable. The circulation density we just developed measures how the direction of the vector field is changing, and thus uses partial derivatives of the components with respect to the transverse variable. In other words, the rotational aspects of the vector field depend on how the horizontal component of the vector field changes when we move vertically (and vice versa).  We could have used shapes other than a square in the development of the circulation density, but the square allows for calculations that are easier to understand as the area of the shape decreases.    Matching Visual Measurements to Algebraic Calculations   Remember that the circulation density of a vector field at a point is calculated as . The circulation density will be positive when a small spinner placed at will spin counterclockwise, negative when the spinner will move clockwise, and zero when the spinner does not rotate.  For each of the vector fields given below, answer the following questions:  What is the formula for the circulation density of the vector field?  For what points will you have a positive circulation density?  For what points will you have a negative circulation density?  For what points will you have a zero circulation density?  Are your answers to the above questions consistent with what you found in a part of ? If so, which part and why?                 Measuring Rotation in Three Dimensions  The previous subsection showed how we can measure the circulation density, or strength of rotation, at a point for a two-dimensional vector field. In this subsection, we will look at how this two-dimensional measurement can be used to define circulation density for three dimensional vector fields.   Rotation as a vector on the -plane    We first need to consider how we want to represent and measure rotation in three dimensions. When we developed the circulation density on the -plane, we measured the rotational strength at a point with an axis of rotation coming out of the -plane. This corresponds to the axis of rotation being given by the blue vector in . Remember that positive rotation corresponds to counterclockwise rotation in the -plane. We can generalize this idea to think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where  the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and  the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.  By convention, we consider positive rotation to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the terminal point of the vector to its initial point. In , you can see that each vector corresponds to the rotation displayed and is consistent with the conventions described above.   Rotation as a vector on each coordinate plane    If you look carefully at , you can see that the vector shown in blue will be parallel to and will represent rotations on planes of the form . Similarly, the vector shown in yellow will be parallel to and will represent rotations on planes of the form . When looking down the blue and yellow vectors (from the terminal to the initial point), you can see the positive coordinate axes as pointing to the right and up When placing the -axis horizontally for the blue vector and placing the -axis horizontally for the yellow vector (as we would expect on a two-dimensional plot). In contrast, when you look down the magenta vector (from the terminal to the initial point), the positive coordinate axes (the and axes) point to the left and up. When placing the -axis horizontally. In fact, when we look down the purple vector the -plane is flipped. A positive rotation on a plane of the form will correspond to a rotation vector that is in the direction of . This is a consequence of the right-handed coordinate system and our right-handed idea of rotation, as reflected in the relationships amongst the vectors recalled below:     With this idea of using a vector to represent the rotation of some element, we have enabled all of the tools that vectors allow, especially the ideas of projection and linear combinations. Remember that the projection of a vector onto a vector will give the vector component of that is parallel to . In other words, the projection of onto is how much of is parallel to . The projection formula will allow us to take a vector representation of rotation and determine how much rotation happens around a given axis of rotation.  Recall that we have used a set of coordinate vectors (namely , , and ) to write other vectors as a linear combination of our base vectors. In other words, a vector in can be written in the form .   The black vector, , is decomposed into parts parallel to , , and .    The linear combination of vectors will allow us to build the total rotation vector by measuring the rotational strength in the direction of three coordinate direction vectors. Just as in Figure , we will build our total rotation vector as a sum of , , and . A rotation vector in the direction of at a point will measure the circulation density at our point restricted to the trace plane . Similarly the rotation vectors in the directions and will measure the circulation density on the trace planes and , respectively.    Circulation Density in Three Dimensions  The previous subsection discussed how we can view the amount of rotation of a three-dimensional vector field in a trace plane parallel to the -, -, or -plane and recalled that vectors in can be written as a linear combination of the vectors , , and . We use our definition of curl for a two-dimensional vector field to measure the amount of rotation in the appropriate trace planes, which leads to the following definition.    Let be a three-dimensional vector field. The curl of is given by      Alternate Notation for Curl  As with divergence, there is an alternate notation for curl that uses the del operator . Specifically, for a three-dimensional vector field , .   The curl is exactly the rotational description described at the end of . When evaluated at a point , the first component of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the plane . Similarly, the second and third components of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the planes and , respectively.   Estimating Curl in Three Dimensions   Look at the vector field plotted in . You can adjust the size of the region around over which the vector field is plotted using the Zoom slider. The Density slider allows you to adjust the number of vectors plotted. Can you see any rotation in the three dimensional vector field plot at the point ? Can you tell how a spinner placed at would rotate? Along which axis? Try to state your answer as a vector representing the rotational strength of the vector field at .   A vector field plotted in a region around the point      You likely found it difficult to decide how you thought a spinner might rotate in this new, three-dimensional setting. Let's look at the vector field in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative.

Vectors point primarily down and are longer when closer to the horizontal axis. In the upper-left of the plot, the vectors point more down and left. In the lower-right of the plot, vectors point more down and right.      Next we will look at the vector field in the plane , as displayed in .

Finally, consider the trace of in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate?

Vectors point predominantly up, although those in the lower-corner point up and left, with vectors becoming closer to upright as one moves to the upper-right corner.      Summarize your prediction to what you think the three-dimensional rotational strength of the vector field will be at the point in the form of three-dimensional vector.   Add your results from the previous three steps.    Compute the curl of . Specifically, what is at the point ?    Compare the result of the curl calculation in part to your prediction from part . You likely found it difficult to estimate the magnitude, so your answer there may be incorrect. Hopefully, you did get the signs of the components and their relative strengths (i.e., which is biggest) correct. If you did not, go back and review the previous parts and explain why the calculated components match with the rotational strength for each of the three figures.      Interpretation and Usage of Curl  The curl of a vector field is itself a vector field in that evaluating at a point gives a vector. As we saw earlier in this section, the vector output of represents the rotational strength of the vector field as a linear combination of rotational strengths (or circulation densities) from two-dimensional planar descriptions. From our description of vectors as a representation of rotations, We can think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where  the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and  the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.  By convention, we consider positive rotation to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the end of the vector to the base.  With these conventions, the output vector of the curl evaluated at a point , written as , will have the following properties:  The direction of will be the axis of rotation that has the strongest positive rotational strength.  The magnitude of will be the circulation density of the vector field in the plane through with normal vector .    The following theorem allows us to use to measure the rotational strength of to around an arbitrary axis. This will be particularly useful to us in later sections.    The rotational strength of a vector field around an axis given by a unit vector at a point can be computed by .    This follows from the formula for the component of along and the fact that was selected to be a unit vector.       In this activity, we will work on calculating curl algebraically and interpreting it.    Consider the vector field . If we plot this vector field in any plane through the origin, we will see the vector field shown in . This two-dimensional vector field has no rotation. The projection of onto any direction therefore must give the zero vector. The only vector that has a zero projection in every direction is the zero vector. Verify this geometric argument for the curl of by doing the calculations necessary to show that .   The vector field on every plane through the origin   A vector field with all vectors radiating from the origin. Vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases.      Now consider the vector field , which is shown in . The figure includes both an interactive three-dimensional plot of as well as a two-dimensional plot of in the yellow plane, which can be adjusted using the Angle of Plane slider.   Two views of the vector field     Based on the figure, would you estimate is positive, negative, or zero at the origin? Does your answer change if you pick a different point?   Calculate algebraically. Does the curl of this vector field vary depending on the point at which the curl is measured?   Explain why the rotational strength of the vector field on a titled plane through the origin will be given by , where is the angle between and the normal vector of the tilted plane.    In you can plot a vector field in a region around a point of your choosing in order to look at the rotational properties of the vector field. The check box in will show the curl vector at the base point specified so you can make sense of your vector field and its curl.   A plot of the vector field    Use the figure to estimate the direction of at the point . Confirm your estimate by calculating the curl at this point algebraically. Is there any point at which the direction of greatest rotational strength of this vector field has negative -component? If there is, find such a point. If not, explain why not.       Summary     The circulation of a vector field on a closed path measures how strong the vector field moves in the direction of travel for the path. The circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field is given by . The circulation density can be visualized in terms of how fast a very small spinner anchored to will rotate as a result of the force of .    By considering the circulation density of a three-dimensional vector field in planes parallel to the coordinate planes, we can calculate the curl of as .    For a three-dimensional vector field , the vector points in the direction of greatest rotational strength at the point . The magnitude of this vector measures the strength of the rotation. The strength of rotation around an axis determined by a unit vector is found by calculating            "

What is the meaning of the double integral of the circulation density of a smooth two-dimensional vector field on a region bounded by a closed curve that does not intersect itself?      We know from that a vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is . It is probably not surprising that, given the multitude of names we have for path-independent vector fields, they are important vector fields that arise frequently. However, not every vector field is path-independent, and many times we will want to calculate the circulation around a closed curve in a vector field that is not path-independent. This section explores a connection between line integrals and double integrals that you may find surprising.    We will consider the vector field , which is defined on the entire plane. Suppose that we want to calculate the circulation of around the circle of radius , centered at , and oriented counterclockwise.    Verify that is not path-independent by calculating the circulation of around the circle . The SageMath cell below is set up to assist you with this, but you will need to supply a parametrization of on line 3.      If we parametrize as , then . To use the SageMath cell to do this, make line 3 read C = vector([2*cos(t),2*sin(t)]) and execute. Because the circulation around is not , we know that is not path-independent.    Consider . In , we discussed the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field at a given point and determined that it can be algebraically determined by . Calculate the circulation density for this vector field.    No; .   Here we have that and , so we have that .    Sketch the curve and shade the region inside it. Describe the region bounded by in both rectangular and polar coordinates.   Polar: , . Rectangular: , .   Since we know the radius of is , the region the circle bounds is covered by all values of with . For , since we have the full disk, the bounds are . In rectangular coordinates, the circle is . The range for is , and solving the equation of the circle for gives us as the bounds for .    Calculate the double integral of over the region inside the circle . This integral is not the most fun to do by hand, so a SageMath cell has been provided to assist you.    If you choose polar coordinates, use for the first variable and for the second variable.     Denote by the region inside the circle . We can describe readily in polar coordinates with the inequalities and . Thus, we need to calculate . Using SageMath to calculate this, we obtain .    A natural question after completing this Preview Activity is if there is something special about the vector field or the curve that led to the results you obtained, and investigating this will be our principal task in this section      Circulation  In , you integrated the circulation density of a smooth vector field over a disk and found the result was equal to the circulation of the vector field along the region's circular boundary. This relationship is the theme of this section. To see why this would make sense, consider the region bounded by the curve shown in . We have placed a square grid inside to suggest the idea of breaking up into many smaller regions, most of which are square. This idea should make you think of the methods we have already seen of breaking up a region into smaller and smaller regions for Riemann sums.   A region bounded by a curve   A bean-shaped region in the plane that is bounded by a closed curve. The curve is oriented so that when walking along the curve, the region is always on the left. There is a square grid dividing the up the interior of the region.    The critical idea here is that if we integrate the circulation density over each of the small regions and add those up, this is the same as integrating the circulation density over the entirety of the region because of the fundamental properties of integrals. Also, integrating circulation per unit area over a two-dimensional region should be related to the total circulation on that region. Now look at and think of these four square regions as being four of the square regions inside in .   A square region divided into four smaller squares   A square region in the plane that is bounded by a closed curve oriented counterclockwise. The square is divided into four squares of equal size, which are labeled as , , , and . There are circular arrows inside each of the smaller regions indicating counterclockwise orientations.    We orient the boundary of square region in the manner suggested by the circular arrows. This means that the vertical boundary in common between and is oriented up when we calculate the line integral and oriented down when we evaluate . Thus, this line segment does not contribute to the sum . The same idea applies to the other three interior line segments so that is equal to the line integral of along the boundary of the large square.  Returning to , if we find the circulation along the boundary of each of the smaller regions, the line integrals along the boundaries that lie inside the region will all offset. Thus the value should equal . If we make our grid fine enough, all of the smaller regions into which is divided will be very close to rectangular. Our next activity looks at the relationship between the circulation along a rectangular curve with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and the double integral of the circulation density over the rectangular region inside the curve.    For this activity, we will consider the region satisfying and . The rectangular curve will be the boundary of , oriented counterclockwise. Let be a vector field that is smooth on and . We can write , where is the top edge of the rectangle and the edges are numbered counterclockwise around the rectangle.    Sketch the region and curves . Label the four corners of with the coordinates of the vertices, and be sure to indicate the proper orientation on .    Since we know that , it makes sense to parametrize each curve and write as a one-variable integral. For example, can be parametrized as with . Thus, we have . Complete this process to write the integrals for the remaining three sides as integrals with respect to or , as appropriate.       The parametrizations rely on fixing for , for , and for .     Write as the sum of two one-variable integrals (one with respect to and one with respect to ).       Because the limits of integration for the integrals match and the limits of integration for the integrals match, we can add and obtain .    We would like to see if the equality of the line integral and double integral in was a coincidence or holds for more general vector fields. (Soon we will expand our curves beyond rectangles, but for the moment, we focus on the curve and region .) To do this, we have to find some way to take our answer to the previous part of this activity, which includes two single integrals and turn them into a double integral over the rectangle .  We have assumed that is smooth on and , so the partial derivatives and are continuous functions on and . Rewrite the expression you have for in the previous step as the sum of two double integrals.   With fixed, the integrand in your integral matches what you see on the left-hand side of the Total Change Theorem , but now instead of prime notation for the derivative, you will have a partial derivative with respect to .       By the Total Change Theorem , with fixed, we have that Therefore, we have .    Rewrite your sum of two double integrals in the previous step above as a double integral over the rectangle , thereby showing that the line integral of along the curve is equal to a double integral of the region inside .       After interchanging the order of integration so that both integrals are done , the other step we must do to add them is to make the integral of have lower limit and upper limit (with respect to ). We do this by multiplying by and then can add the integrals to obtain .    Now we can see that our result in was not a coincidence and integrating the circulation density of a smooth vector field on a rectangular region gives the same result as calculating the circulation along the boundary of the region.    The phenomenon we verified for rectangular regions in is a more general result that will be the subject of our next section.    Green's Theorem  So far in this section, we have restricted ourselves to relatively nice closed curves when thinking about circulation. While the main theorem of this section will not allow us to consider arbitrary closed curves, it does cover more varied curves than we have discussed so far. A simple closed curve is a closed curve that does not cross itself, and these are the curves to which our next theorem applies.   A closed curve that is not simple  The restriction that the curve in prohibits curves such as the one below, which crosses itself.   A curve in the shape of a figure eight     Green's Theorem   Let be a simple closed curve in the plane that bounds a region with oriented in such a way that when walking along in the direction of its orientation, the region is on our left. Suppose that is vector field with continuous partial derivatives on the region and its boundary . The circulation of along may be calculated as .    In , we showed that holds when the region is a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The discussion that introduced the previous subsection may have you convinced that holds in its full form. Although our argument there was not a rigorous proof, we will not say more about why this theorem is true in full generality.   At first glance, it may seem that is of purely intellectual interest. However, we have already encountered situations where parametrization a curve can be complicated. This is particularly true when the curve has corners that require us to give separate parametrizations for several pieces of the curve, such as with the rectangular curve pictured in . However, as with this rectangle, is often the case that a curve that is difficult to parametrize bounds a region that is not too complex to describe using rectangular or polar coordinates. For instance, the rectangular region in can be described as and , rather than parametrization each of the four sides of the rectangle separately. Additionally, the integrand of the double integral in involves partial derivatives that can sometimes result in an integrand that is very easy to work with. The purpose of is, at its core, to allow you to exchange one type of integration problem (a line integral) for another type of integration problem (a double integral). This will be a recurring theme as this chapter continues.   A rectangular curve   A rectangular curve in the -plane. The lower-left corner is labeled . The upper-right corner is labeled . The curve is oriented counterclockwise.    The next activity asks you to apply .    For each of the curves described below, find the circulation of the given vector field around the curve. Do this both by calculating the line integral directly as well as by calculating the double integral from .    The curve is the circle of radius centered at the point (oriented counterclockwise) and the vector field is .     Here we find that . Therefore, the integrand in is the constant . Thus, the circulation of around is times the area of the region inside . That area is , which means that the circulation is .    The curve is the triangle with vertices , , and (oriented counterclockwise) and the vector field is .     Here we find that . The region inside can be described by and . Therefore, by , we have .    Generally, is useful for allowing us to calculate line integrals by instead calculating a double integral. Going the other direction is harder, since finding a vector field so that is equal to the integrand in the double integral can be difficult. However, the exercises will explore some situations where calculating a suitable line integral is a viable alternative to the double integral.    What happens when vector fields are not smooth?  Notice that the assumptions in require that the region be bounded by a simple closed curve and that the vector field have continuous partial derivatives on and . In , we will explore what happens when the region cannot be bounded by a simple closed curve, as sometimes multiple applications of can be used in those circumstances. Now, however, we will take a look at what happens in some cases where the vector field is not smooth.    Consider the vector field . Notice that is smooth everywhere in the plane other than at the point . This vector field is plotted in , but we have not plotted the vectors close to the origin as their magnitudes get so large that they make it hard to interpret the figure. Here applies to any simple closed curve that neither passes through nor bounds a region containing .   The vector field   A vector field with vectors tangent to circles oriented counterclockwise and centered at the origin as well as the unit circle centered at the origin and oriented counterclockwise. The vectors are longer close to the origin and shorter farther from the origin.      Find the circulation density of (i.e., the integrand of the double integral in ).   Make sure to note any exceptional points at which your formula is not valid.   for   For , we have . Thus, .    Suppose that is the unit circle centered at the origin. Without doing any calculations, what can you say about ? what does this tell you about if is path-independent?   Positive; is not path-independent   Notice that is tangent to . Thus, must be positive. (In fact, the circulation of along is the length of or because consists of unit vectors and the vector field is is tangent to .) Since there is a closed curve with nonzero circulation, is not path independent.    What would you get if you integrated the circulation density of over the region bounded by ?   The circulation density is everywhere inside except at the origin, where it is undefined. That single point does not impact the value of the double integral of the circulation density, which is thus .    Do the previous two parts contradict ? Explain your reasoning.   No.   There is no contradiction because does not apply here. The region inside the curve includes the point , and is not defined at that point. Green's Theorem requires that the vector field be smooth at every point of .    Is the vector field , which is shown in , path-independent? Why or why not?   The vector field    A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin and orthogonal to circles centered at the origin. Vectors are longest near the origin and get shorter farther from the origin.     Yes   Let . Note that , and the domain of is the same as the domain of (all of except ). Thus, is a gradient vector field and is therefore path-independent.    Suppose that is the unit circle centered at the origin. Find . Can you do this using ?   ; No   We have already shown that is path-independent, and therefore since is a closed curve. Because is not defined at the origin, does not apply to this line integral.    We can now see that is a powerful tool. However it cannot be used for all line integrals. In particular, the restriction that the vector field be smooth on the entire region bounded by a simple closed curve creates limitations. This can occur even in cases where holes in the vector field's domain or points where the vector field is not continuously differentiable lie away from .    Summary      tells us that we can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field along a simple closed curve that bounds a region in the plane on which the vector field is also smooth by calculating the double integral of the circulation density instead of the line integral.    Integrating the circulation density of a smooth vector field on a region bounded by a simple closed curve gives the same value as calculating the circulation of the vector field around the boundary of the region with suitable orientation.        Sometimes, the value in is in converting a double integral into a line integral. Recall that the area of a region in the plane can be found by calculating .   Find a smooth vector field such that the circulation density of is everywhere.  There are several ways to choose so that .  Write out both integrals in for the vector field you selected in part .   For positive real numbers , the ellipse can be parametrized as with . Find the area of this ellipse by calculating a line integral.   Find another vector field (different from the one you found in part ) that has circulation density everywhere, and calculate the area of the ellipse in part by calculating the circulation of along the ellipse.   How many possible vector fields are there with circulation density everywhere? Why?    The types of regions in to which applies are formally called simply connected regions . To be precise, a simply connected region in is a set so that there is a path between every pair of points in that stays inside and any simple closed curve in can be shrunk to a point while remaining inside . We can think of a simply connected region as being a region that does not have any holes . There are many instances where we can find a way to apply multiple times to work with regions that are not simply connected, however.    A region that is not simply connected     Breaking up a region       Explain why the region in is not simply connected.    If we let , then the orientation of is as required by when walking along the pieces of , the region is always on the left-hand side. Assume that is a vector field that is smooth on and . Using as a guide, write as a sum of double integrals, one over and the other over .    In , we considered the vector field and found that the circulation of around the unit circle centered at the origin (oriented counterclockwise) was . Show that for every simple closed curve in the plane that bounds a region containing the origin, .     For part , create a region as in using the curve in place of .     A curve enclosing cannot be contracted to a point.   Work as in the previous part with and being the clockwise-oriented circle of radius centered at the origin with small enough that lies entirely inside .        A simple closed curve lying in the region that encloses the curve cannot be contracted to a point while remaining in the region , so this region is not simply connected.    Assume that and are oriented from bottom to top. Then . The curve in the first set of parentheses in bounds the region , and the curve in the second set of parentheses bounds the region . Since is smooth on and , applies and we have .    Let be the circle of radius , centered at the origin and oriented clockwise , with chosen to be small enough that lies entirely within . Then is exactly the type of curve considered in the previous part, as is smooth on the curves and the region they bound. Here for all points in and , so the double integrals from are . Thus, we have that . Since is tangent to everywhere, we know that .       This exercise presents another occasion where can be used to convert a double integral into a line integral.   Recall from that the centroid of a lamina of area is given by . Find vector fields and so that , where is the boundary of the lamina .    Find the centroid of the triangle with vertices , , and for real numbers .         and (other answers are possible)    and        For , we need . It works nicely to let , in which case taking gives what we need. For , we need . It works nicely to let , in which case taking gives what we need.    Using the vector fields from above, note that the line integrals along the legs of the triangle are for both and . Thus, we parametrize the hypotenuse as with . The area of the triangle is , so we find .        "

How can we calculate the amount of a vector field that flows through common surfaces, such as the graph of a function ?       showed how we can use vector valued functions of two variables to give a parametrization of a surface in space. For instance, the function with domain and parametrizes a sphere of radius centered at the origin. also gives examples of how to write parametrizations based on other geometric relationships like when one coordinate can be written as a function of the other two. In , we set up a Riemann sum based on a parametrization that would measure the surface area of our curved surfaces in space.  In , you can see a surface plotted using a parametrization . The red lines represent curves where varies and is held constant, while the yellow lines represent curves where varies and is held constant. The vector in red is which measures the direction and magnitude of change in the coordinates of the surface when just is varied. Similarly, the vector in yellow is which measures the direction and magnitude of change in the coordinates of the surface when just is varied.

A three-dimensional plot of    From , we also know that (plotted in green) will be orthogonal to both and and its magnitude will be given by the area of the parallelogram.    In this activity we will explore the parametrizations of a few familiar surfaces and confirm some of the geometric properties described in the introduction above.

Draw your vector results from on your graphs and confirm the geometric properties described in the introduction to this section. Namely, and should be tangent to the surface, while should be orthogonal to the surface (in addition to and ).    As we saw in , we can set up a Riemann sum of the areas for the parallelograms in to approximate the surface area of the region plotted by our parametrization. Equation shows that we can compute the exact surface by taking a limit of a Riemann sum which will correspond to integrating the magnitude of over the appropriate parameter bounds. What if we wanted to measure a quantity other than the surface area? In the next section, we will explore a specific case of this question: How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a surface? The geometric tools we have reviewed in this section will be very valuable, especially the vector .    The Idea of the Flux of a Vector Field through a Surface  In , we illustrate the situation that we wish to study in the remainder of this section. We have a piece of a surface, shown by using shading. There is also a vector field, perhaps representing some fluid that is flowing. We are interested in measuring the flow of the fluid through the shaded surface portion.   A three-dimensional vector field and a surface    We don't care about the vector field away from the surface, so we really would like to just examine what the output vectors for the points on our surface. So instead, we will look at .   A three-dimensional vector field evaluated along a surface    The central question we would like to consider is How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a curved surface? , so we only need to consider the amount of the vector field that flows through the surface. Any portion of our vector field that flows along (or tangent) to the surface will not contribute to the amount that goes through the surface. In the next figure, we have split the vector field along our surface into two components. One component, plotted in green, is orthogonal to the surface. The component that is tangent to the surface is plotted in purple.   The decomposition of three-dimensional vector field evaluated along a surface into normal and tangent components    In order to measure the amount of the vector field that moves through the plotted section of the surface, we must find the accumulation of the lengths of the green vectors in . Notice that some of the green vectors are moving through the surface in a direction opposite of others. In other words, we will need to pay attention to the direction in which these vectors move through our surface and not just the magnitude of the green vectors.  If we have a parametrization of the surface, then the vector varies smoothly across our surface and gives a consistent way to describe which direction we choose as through the surface. If we define a positive flow through our surface as being consistent with the yellow vector in , then there is more positive flow (in terms of both magnitude and area) than negative flow through the surface. Thus, the net flow of the vector field through this surface is positive.   Visualizing flux through a surface   In this activity, you will compare the net flow of different vector fields through our sample surface. In you can select between five different vector fields. Once you select a vector field, the vector field for a set of points on the surface will be plotted in blue. Each blue vector will also be split into its normal component (in green) and its tangential component (in purple). The yellow vector defines the direction for positive flow through the surface.  Look at each vector field and order the vector fields from greatest flow through the surface to least flow through the surface. Remember that a negative net flow through the surface should be lower in your rankings than any positive net flow.   Five vector fields flowing through a surface, with decomposition into normal and tangential components        Measuring the Flux of a Vector Field through a Surface  Now that we have a better conceptual understanding of what we are measuring, we can set up the corresponding Riemann sum to measure the flux of a vector field through a section of a surface. Let be the section of our surface and suppose that is parametrized by with and . The domain of is a region of the -plane, which we call , and the range of is .  In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints and into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints . This divides into rectangles of size by . We index these rectangles as . Every has area (in the -plane) of . The partition of into the rectangles also partitions into corresponding pieces which we call . From (specifically ) the surface area of is approximated by .   Pieces of the tangent planes that approximate a surface    We want to measure the total flow of the vector field, , through , which we approximate on each and then sum to get the total flow. In other words, the flux of through is , where is the length of the component of orthogonal to .  For each , we approximate the surface by the tangent plane to at a corner of that partition element. This corresponds to using the planar elements in , which have surface area . The vector can be used to measure the orthogonal direction (and thus define which direction we mean by positive flow through ) on the partition element. This means that   Combining these pieces, we find that the flux through is approximated by , where . Therefore we may approximate the total flux by . Taking the limit as gives the following result.    Let a smooth surface be parametrized by over a domain . The total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .    In , you can change the number of sections in your partition and see the geometric result of refining the partition. The next activity asks you to carefully go through the process of calculating the flux of some vector fields through a cylindrical surface.   Checking the Visualization for Flux    shows a plot of the vector field and a right circular cylinder of radius and height (with open top and bottom). Consider the vector field going into the cylinder (toward the -axis) as corresponding to a positive flux.   The vector field and a right circular cylinder     Reasoning graphically, do you think the flux of throught the cylinder will be positive, negative, or zero?   Parametrize the right circular cylinder of radius , centered on the -axis for . Be sure to give bounds on your parameters.   Based on your parametrization, compute , , and . Confirm that these vectors are either orthogonal or tangent to the right circular cylinder. Is your orthogonal vector pointing in the direction of positive flux or negative flux?   Use your parametrization to write as a function of and .   The coordinate is given by the first component of .   Compute the flux of through the parametrized portion of the right circular cylinder.   Does your computed value for the flux match your prediction from earlier?   Use to make an argument about why the flux of through the right circular cylinder is zero.   The vector field with normal and tangential components plotted on a right circular cylinder      How would the results of the flux calculations be different if we used the vector field and the same right circular cylinder? Explain your reasoning.    How would the results of the flux calculations be different if we used the vector field and the same right circular cylinder? Explain your reasoning.      Efficiently Calculating Flux Integrals  In this section, we will look at some computational ideas to help us more efficiently compute the value of a flux integral. In many cases, the surface we are looking at the flux through can be written with one coordinate as a function of the others. For simplicity, we consider .   Flux Through Surfaces of the Form   In this activity, we will look at how to use a parametrization of a surface that can be described as to efficiently calculate flux integrals.    Suppose that is a surface given by . Find a parametrization of .   Use and .    Show that the vector orthogonal to the surface has the form .    For each of the three surfaces given below, compute , graph the surface, and compute for four different points of your choosing. You should make sure your vectors are orthogonal to your surface.

Calculating the Flux through a Sphere   For this activity, let be the sphere of radius centered at the origin.    Parametrize using spherical coordinates.

Explain why the outward pointing orthogonal vector on the sphere is a multiple of and what that scalar expression means.   Use your parametrization of and the results of part to calculate the flux through for each of the three following vector fields.         Use computer software to plot each of the vector fields from part and interpret the results of your flux integral calculations.  If we used the sphere of radius 4 instead of , explain how each of the flux integrals from part would change. You do not need to calculate these new flux integrals, but rather explain if the result would be different and how the result would be different.    Note that throughout this section, we have implicitly assumed that we can parametrize the surface in such a way that gives a well-defined normal vector. Technically, this means that the surface be orientable . Most reasonable surfaces are orientable. However, there are surfaces that are not orientable. Perhaps the most famous is formed by taking a long, narrow piece of paper, giving one end a half twist, and then gluing the ends together. Try doing this yourself, but before you twist and glue (or tape), poke a tiny hole through the paper on the line halfway between the long edges of your strip of paper and circle your hole. After gluing, place a pencil with its eraser end on your dot and the tip pointing away. Think of this as a potential normal vector. Keep the eraser on the paper, and follow the middle of your surface around until the first time the eraser is again on the dot. Is your pencil still pointing the same direction relative to the surface that it was before?

How do scalar surface integrals relate to flux integrals?      In , the idea of a flux integral was introduced by looking at how much of a vector field flows through a given section of a surface in space. In particular, the flux integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is orthogonal to the surface (which changes at different points on the surface.) shows the best way to calculate the flux integral in terms of a parameterization of the surface. This was an extension of the method for computing the surface area given in .  Just as we generalized line integrals of vector fields into scalar line integrals in , we will spend this section looking at the following questions:  How could we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a surface in space?  What would that accmulation measure?  What is the most efficient way to calculate this?      Defining surface integrals of scalar functions  In order to create a Riemann sum that will measure the acculumation of , a scalar valued function, over . a bounded smooth surface in space, we will break our surface into smaller piecese where we can approximate the output of and the surface area of each piece. In and , we developed the way to measure surface area given a parameterization for the surface.  Suppose that is parametrized by with and . In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints and into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints . This divides into rectangles of size by . We index these rectangles as . Every has area (in the -plane) of . The partition of into the rectangles also partitions into corresponding pieces which we call . From (specifically ) the surface area of is approximated by .   Pieces of the tangent planes used to approximate surface area    So to measure the accumulation of the output of over we use the following Riemann sum: This Riemann sum ends up being the double integral (over the variables and ) of the function , which leads to the following theorem.    Let a smooth surface be parametrized by over a domain and let be a continuous function on a neighborhood around . The acculumation of over is deonted by and is called the scalar surface integral of over . The scalar surface integral of over is computed as .      In this activity, we will try to understand the scalar surface integral by looking at whether the value of the scalar surface integral will be positive, negative, or zero over a common surfaces.    Throughout this activity we will use one of three surfaces.

Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation. If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analogue amongst the properties of definite integrals.   Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , scalar valued functions and , and oriented surfaces and , the following properties hold:                          Explaining Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals   In this activity, we will be explaining each of the Properties from in the context of a new analogy. We have just purchased a plot of land that spans two mountains, Sugar Mountain and Spice Mountain. We will label the plot of land on Sugar Mountain and the plot of land on Spice Mountain . Unfortunately there are two types of toxic organisms on the surface of your new land (which may be why you got the land so cheap). Let be the density of the toxic fungus on your new plot of land and let be the density of toxic bacteria on the new plot.   Explain in your own words what means in the above analogy and what exactly would be measured by this scalar line integral. The scalar surface integral would calculate the accumulation of toxic fungus on the Sugar Mountain part of your plot. In particular, measures the total amount of toxic fungus on your Sugar Mountain land. The scalar surface integral would calculate the accumulation of toxic fungus on the Sugar Mountain part of your plot.

For this example, we will compute the answer to . We will compute where is the disc of radius one centered at on the fundamental plane. Our surface can be parameterized by where and .

  "title": "Stokes' Theorem",
  "body": " Stokes' Theorem     What is the relationship between the circulation of a vector field along a simple closed curve in three-dimensional space and the flux integral of through a surface with as its boundary?    Why does the flux integral of through a surface with boundary only depend on the boundary of the surface and not the shape of the surface's interior?      When we studied in , we saw how integrating the circulation density over a region in the plane bounded by a simple closed curve gave an alternative way of calculating the circulation along the boundary curve. When we consider simple closed curves in , the situation gets more complicated. However, there is an interesting, and perhaps surprising, generalization of for us to examine.    In this activity, we will look at how we can apply the ideas about circulation along overlapping curves from the beginning of to curves in space.    For this part, consider the curves in Figure , where the yellow curve is , the blue curve is , and the magenta curve is .   Three curves in space     Write out the circulation line integrals of the closed curve consisting of the yellow curve and the and blue curve . (Remember to consider orientation!)   Write out the circulation line integrals of the closed curve consisting of the magenta curve and the blue curve . (Remember to consider orientation!)   Write out the circulation line integrals of the closed curve consisting of the yellow curve and the magenta curve .   Why does it make sense that we can add the results of the first two parts and get the third?   Would your arguments from above change at all if you considered the curves depicted in ?   Three slightly different curves in space      We will now let be the simple closed curve consisting of the yellow and magenta curves in . You can see plotted in red in . The drop-down allows you to select three different surfaces. Visually verify that each of the three surfaces contains . Notice that the scale on the -axis changes as you select different surfaces.   Surfaces containing a common simple closed curve         Circulation in three dimensions and Stokes' Theorem  In , we saw that a simple closed curve in can bound many different surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface in that has a well-defined normal vector at every point and a boundary curve . We will use the normal vector to define an orientation of so that if a person were to walk along in the direction of the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the direction of , their left arm would be over the surface . Notice that this is the same convention that we used with if we assume that the normal vector being used is .  In , we show the curve from in magenta as well as a surface that has as its boundary. The chosen normal vector to is shown, as is the orientation of that matches .   A surface (and normal vector) bounded by an oriented simple closed curve    Thinking back to , our main idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple closed curve in by taking the double integral of the circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw in , we can break up into line integrals around other simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green's Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green's Theorem, we require that a simple closed curve in three dimensions bound a smooth surface with a normal vector . In doing this, we can choose our smaller curves similar to the squares we used in Green's Theorem to lie on the surface . This gives us almost all the ingredients used in Green's Theorem, but we still need to find a suitable replacement for the circulation density.  As we saw in , the curl of a vector field in measures the rotation of the vector field. says that for a unit vector , the scalar measures the rotational strength of at the point around the axis defined by . When is the normal vector to the surface at the point , we have the appropriate analog for the circulation density of on at . Thus, the equivalent idea to integrating the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field over a region in the plane is calculating the flux integral , where on the domain gives a parametrization of the smooth surface .  A rigorous proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of this text. However, the previous subsection and our discussion of provide an intuitive description of why this theorem is true.   Stokes' Theorem   Let be a smooth surface in with a simple closed curve as its boundary. Let be a vector field that is smooth on and . Suppose that on the domain gives a parametrization of for which is oriented so that a person walking along in the direction of its orientation and head pointing in the direction of the normal vector would have their left hand above . In this setting, the circulation of along is equal to the flux of through . That is, .    When we looked , it was generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the circumstances described in exercises and , we did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector field. The situation for will be similar, with the exception of in this section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional piece of freedom: selecting the surface through which we calculate the flux of from amongst possibly several reasonable surfaces with boundary . The next two activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their boundary.    Because requires us to consider a surface (with normal vector) and the boundary of the surface, this activity will give you a chance to practice identifying the boundary of some surfaces in . For each surface below:  Describe the boundary in words.  Find a parametrization for the boundary.  Ensure that a person walking along the boundary in the direction of your parametrization with head pointing in the direction of the surface's normal vector would hold their left hand over the surface.      The surface is the portion of the sphere described below. Assume the outward orientation on the sphere.   The points with .   The points with .    The surface is the portion of the hyperbolic paraboloid with . Assume the upward orientation, e.g., the normal vector at is .    The surface is the portion of the cylinder for which , assuming the outward orientation.   It is fine for the boundary of a surface to be made up of more than one curve. Think carefully about how each piece is oriented!      In some sense, this activity considers the reverse problem of that considered in . Here, each part of the activity gives you an oriented simple closed curve in , and your task is to find  a surface so that is the boundary of and  a normal vector for the so that a person walking along in the direction of the given orientation with head pointing in the direction of your chosen normal vector would have their left hand over .  You are encouraged to think about multiple possible answers, since as we saw in , there may be more than one reasonable choice of a surface with a particular boundary.    The curve is the triangle with vertices , , and with orientation corresponding to the order the points are listed here.    The curve is the circle parametrized as for .    The curve consists of (given in order of the orientation)  the quarter-circle of radius centered at the origin in the -plane from to ,  the line segment from to ,  the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and  the line segment from to .        Verifying and Applying Stokes' Theorem  We close this section with a pair of activities. The first focuses on calculating both of the integrals in . The second asks you to calculate some line integrals along simple closed curves and gives you the discretion to choose the best method to use for this (as well as the best surface to use, if you choose Stokes' Theorem).    In this activity, we will verify by calculating both a line integral and a flux integral.    Consider the vector field and the circle parametrized as for .   Calculate directly using the given parametrization.   Let be the hemisphere of the sphere of radius centered at the origin with . Calculate the flux of through .   What could you have observed about that would have gotten you the same answer without doing either of the above calculations?    Consider the vector field and the curve , which is the triangle with vertices , , and with orientation corresponding to the order the points are listed here.   Find the circulation of along by calculating the appropriate line integrals.   The vertices of lie in a plane. Let be the portion of this plane lying in the first octant, i.e., the portion with . Find the flux of through .   Explain why the sign of your answer to the previous two parts makes sense.      Find the circulation of along the curve consisting of (given in order of the orientation) the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , the line segment from to , the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and the line segment from to .    Find the circulation of along the circle in the -plane of radius centered at the origin. Assume the counterclockwise orientation of the circle.    In part part of , there are two reasonable choices for the surface bounded by the circle. If you did not do so while doing the activity, we encourage you to identify both of them and compare which one makes doing the flux integral easier. In general, this will vary depending on the (curl of the) vector field in question, so we cannot give a rule for determining what surface or coordinate system to use. However, we do encourage you to think about which surface will make evaluating the flux integral easiest.    Summary      tells us that we can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field along a simple closed curve in that bounds a surface (with normal vector) on which the vector field is also smooth by calculating the flux of the curl of the vector field through the surface.    Given two surfaces and with the same boundary (and assuming normal vectors that give the same orientation on ), the flux of through and through is the same because tells us that this flux is equal to the circulation of along .        is generally used to turn a line integral into a flux integral. Sometimes it is possible to be given a flux integral and recognize that the given vector field is for some vector field , however. When this is the case, we call a vector potential for the vector field , much like a function so that is called a potential function for .   Find a vector field so that .   Your experience in finding potential functions for gradient vector fields will be useful to you here, although you will have more flexibility.   When finding an anti-derivative of a function of a single variable, you know that there is an infinite family of anti-derivatives, but that any two anti-derivatives differ by a constant. This is why we write expressions such as . A similar phenomenon occurs with (scalar) potential functions for gradient vector fields. Find a second vector field with the same curl as in part , and do so in a way that is not a constant vector. That is, after simplifying fully, must contain at least one of the variables .   Verify that for the vector fields you found above, is a gradient vector field. Explain why for every pair of vector potentials for a vector field , you must have that is a gradient vector field.   Explain why if is a vector field with a vector potential , . Such a vector field is called a solenoidal vector field or divergence-free vector field .    "

How can we efficiently calculate the flux through a closed surface in when that surface must be parametrized in several pieces?       In we examined vector fields for how the strength of a vector field changes in different regions. In particular, we developed the divergence of a vector field as a local measurement (based on density) of how the strength of the vector field changes. In particular, we did this by looking at the flux of the vector field through a closed path in two dimensions, then generalizing these ideas to higher dimensions.  In , we measured how much of a vector field flowed through a section of a surface in three dimensions as a generalization of our argument from . In this section, we will connect the ideas of flux of a vector field through a closed surface in three dimensions and the divergence of that vector field.  A surface in three dimensions is said to be closed if it has no boundary. Recalling the surfaces we studied in where we applied , none of those surfaces were closed because the boundary of the surface through which we calculated the flux was the curve along which we calculated the circulation. In , we show two surfaces that are not closed, as demonstrated by the red curves marking the edge where the surface ends.   Two surfaces that are not closed    In fact, the yellow cylinder has two edges where the surface ends (does not meet itself). The surfaces in  are closed because there is no edge to the surface. Note that the cylinder has been filled in with a cap at top and bottom (plotted in gray and green, respectively) to become a closed surface.   Two closed surfaces    Closed surfaces can be used to define the boundary of a volume in space. If we have the top and bottom on our cylinder, we have a well-defined volume of space, in that we know which points are inside the volume and which are outside of the volume. With different top and bottom surfaces, the enclosed volume would be different. illustrates three different ways to complete the cylindrical surface into a closed surface.   Three ways to close a cylindrical surface by adding a top and bottom      Measuring the Flux through a Closed Surface   Locating sources of a poisonous gas   We will use three different surfaces to examine the flux through closed surfaces. Let be the top half of the unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in magenta in the figures below). Let be the bottom half of the unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in yellow). Finally, let be the unit disk centered at the origin in the -plane (graphed in blue). With these definitions, and will make a closed surface given by the unit sphere. The surfaces and will enclose the top half of the unit ball, while and will enclose the bottom half of the unit ball.  In this problem we will be using the surfaces defined above and the flux integrals of a poisonous gas through these surfaces to try to whether different regions of space are emitting or absorbing the poisonous gas.   In this part, we will consider the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. If the flux integral of a poisonous gas through is and the flux integral of the poison gas through is , is the interior of the sphere emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.  Unit ball with boundary given by the combination of and    In this part, we will consider the top half of the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. If the flux integral of a poisonous gas through is and the flux integral of the poison gas through is , is the top half of the unit ball emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.  Upper half of the unit ball with boundaries given by and    In this part, we will consider the bottom half of the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. Based on the information given in the previous two parts, what will the flux integrals of the poison gas be for and be in this case? Be sure to pay attention to the orientation of what we consider positive flow. Explain your reasoning.  Lower half of the unit ball with boundaries given by and    Using your answer from the previous part, is the bottom half of the unit ball emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.   The preview activity showed how the flux through a closed surface can be subdivided into the flux through surfaces which combine to be the closed surface (with orientation switches corresponding to additive inverse). The net flux through the closed surface measures the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed on the interior of the closed surface.    The Divergence Theorem  The divergence of a vector field was developed as a measurement of the density with which the strength of vector field is changing. In three dimensions, the divergence measures the volume density in which the vector field is being created or destroyed. This means that if we integrate the divergence of a vector field over a volume of space, we will get the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed in that particular volume of space. Since the net amount of a vector field that is created or destroyed in a volume of space is the same as the net flux of the vector field through the boundary of that volume (which is a closed surface), we have a correspondence between a triple integral of the divergence of a vector field on the interior of a closed surface and the flux integral of the vector field over the closed surface.   Divergence Theorem   Let be a closed surface in three dimensional space and let be the volume bounded by . If is a vector field that has continuous first partial derivatives on and , then where the integral on the left measures the flux through in terms of the outward pointing normal vector.    The preview activity and the discussion before the statement of the have hopefully given you some intuition as to why the theorem is true. The ideas should also seem similar to the manner in which we approached and . The next activity walks you through evaluating both the flux integrals necessary to calculate the flux directly and the triple integral of the divergence theorem for a specific vector field and closed surface.    In this activity, we will look at calculating both sides of a non-trivial example of the . We will look at the region inside the right circular cylinder shown in .

Compute the divergence of and use this to explain whether you think will be positive, negative, or zero.    Set up and compute the triple integral for .  Use cylindrical coordinates.   Verify that your answers for part and part are the same and thus that the Divergence Theorem holds for this example.    Was the left-hand side or right-hand side of the equation in the Divergence Theorem more tedious to calculate in this example? Do you think this will be true for most other cases where the Divergence Theorem applies?    We finish this section with an activity that asks you to calculate the flux of a vector field through some closed surfaces without guiding you step-by-step.    Calculate the flux of the given vector field through the surface for each situation below.    The vector field through the tetrahedron with vertices , , , and .    The vector field through the closed portion of the sphere of radius centered at the origin having .   By itself, is not a closed surface. However, think about what additional surface you need to add to make a closed surface.      Summary     A closed surface is one that has no boundary.
