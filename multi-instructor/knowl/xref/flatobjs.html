<div class="para">Before we move on to our discussion of planes in the next section, we will talk about some terminology that may helpful in describing features and measurements later. A line is a one-dimensional, flat graph in three (or <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) dimensions. We say the line is a one-dimensional graph because there is only one direction (forward/backward) to go while staying on the graph. We say that a line is flat because the direction you are allowed to go doesn’t change as you move along the graph. Note that flat does <em class="emphasis">not</em> mean horizontal. A circle would be another example of a one-dimensional graph that can be drawn in two or more dimensional space (because there is only one direction to move along the circle). However, a circle is not flat since the direction you go to stay on the figure changes as you move along the graph. As we will see in the next section, a plane in three dimensional space is an example of a flat, two-dimensional graph. If you were an ant on a plane, you would have two directions (forward/backward or left/right) to move in while staying on the graph. However, the directions that the graph extends do not change when you change locations on the plane.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#flatobjs" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
