<p>SOLUTION</p> <p>1. The line integral is zero along the vertical and horizontal segments, since the vectors are perpendicular to the segments. The vectors along the slanted segment generally point in opposite direction of the curve. Thus the line integral is negative.</p> <p>2. The vectors are perpendicular to the line segments of the curve. Thus the line integral is zero .</p> <p>3. The line integral along the curve in the first quadrant is counterbalanced by the line integral in the third quadrant. Similarly for the line integrals in the second and fourth quadrant. Thus the total line integral is zero.</p> <p>4. Vectors with larger magnitude generally point in the opposite direction of the curve. Thus the line integral is negative .</p> <p>5. The vectors are perpendicular to the circles, thus the line integral along the circles is zero. The line integrals along the orizontal and vertical segments counterbalance one another since they have opposite signs. Thus the total line integral is zero .</p> <p>6. The line integral is zero along the vertical and horizontal segments, since the vectors are perpendicular to the segments. The vectors along the larger circle (with larger magnitude than the vectors along the smaller circle) generally point in same direction of the curve. Thus the line integral is positive .</p>
