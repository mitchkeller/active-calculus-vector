<div class="introduction"><div class="para">In this exercise we want to relate the scalar and vector measurements involved in the splitting of acceleration to different modes of transportation. While everyone has different experiences with piloting different modes of transportation, we will phrase this question in terms of driving a car. Feel free to substitute another mode of transportation like riding a bike, riding a scooter, driving a boat, rowing a boat, flying a plane, or flying a spaceship.</div></div>

<div class="para">In the context of driving a car (or substitute your mode of transportation), write a couple sentences about what vector calculus quantity is controlled by the brake pedal. Be specific which vector calculus quantity is involved and how the brake pedal changes this measurement.</div>
