<div class="para">You may have generalized the idea of the definite integral by looking at the accumulation of a function. We will spend some time and more detail on this idea here because this is will be important for our uses later and many students may not have seen or fully understood these steps. In this description, we will look at an object moving in one dimension (along the number line) in which we are trying to find the position of the object as a function (<span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span>) when we know the starting position (<span class="process-math">\(x(0)=x_0\)</span>) and the velocity of the object (<span class="process-math">\(v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt}=x'(t)\)</span>).<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#accumulation-1-1" title="Copy permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Key Idea 10.2.3"><a href="#accumulation" title="Copy permalink for Key Idea 10.2.3">🔗</a></div></article><details class="hiddenproof born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><h3 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h3></summary><article class="hiddenproof knowl__content"><div class="para">In many physical problems it is much easier to measure and keep track of velocity rather than position. This is because velocity is a local measurement but position isn’t. This may sound a little weird so we will look at our analogy of piloting a car (or a bike or boat or spaceship, if you prefer). If you were to try to keep track of your position for all times on a trip in your car/bike/boat/spaceship, you would need to set up a coordinate system and constantly measure your distance to things like your axes or coordinate planes to find your location. This means you have to measure well outside of your car/bike/boat/spacecraft and this requires an external view of your car/bike/boat/spacecraft. This is why systems like GPS satellites and receivers are necessary for accurate global navigation. Note here that your car doesn’t need something outside of itself to measure its speed because the speed is a measure of how much position changes relative to a small step around wherever you are.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#accumulation-2-1" title="Copy permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para">So the big idea we will use is that velocity is the change in position over time, <span class="process-math">\(\text{velocity}=\frac{\Delta \text{position}}{\Delta \text{time}}\text{,}\)</span> which means that we can measure a <em class="emphasis">change</em> in position by taking the velocity times the change in time (<span class="process-math">\(\Delta \text{position}=\text{velocity} \Delta \text{time}\)</span>) if velocity is constant. We can use a classic calculus approach to use velocity to approximate, refine, then precisely state the position as a function of time.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#accumulation-2-2" title="Copy permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Starting at time <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> we know the position of our object because <span class="process-math">\(x(0)=x_0\text{,}\)</span> so we need to use the velocity to measure the change in position (on the number line) between <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> and time <span class="process-math">\(t=a\text{.}\)</span> We will approximate this change in position using <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \text{position}=\text{velocity} \Delta \text{time}\text{.}\)</span> In particular, we will break up the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,a]\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> equally sized pieces (<span class="process-math">\(\Delta t= \frac{a}{n}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(t_0=0, t_1=\Delta t, \ldots, t_{n-1}=(n-1)\Delta t, t_n =a\)</span>).  Mathematically, the position at <span class="process-math">\(t=a\)</span> will be given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x(t=a)=x_0+ \Delta x_1 + \ldots + \Delta x_n 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x_i\)</span> is change in position from <span class="process-math">\(t_{i-1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t_i\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#accumulation-2-3" title="Copy permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">On each piece we will approximate the change in position by taking the velocity for some time in this interval and multiply by <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{.}\)</span> We evaluate the velocity at some point in the interval <span class="process-math">\([t_{i-1},t_i]\)</span> , which we will denote <span class="process-math">\(v(t_i^*)\text{,}\)</span> which means our estimate will be <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x_i \approx v(t_i^*) \Delta t \text{.}\)</span> Our estimate of the position of our object at <span class="process-math">\(t=a\)</span> will be given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x(a)\approx x_0+\sum_{i=1}^n v(t_i^*) \Delta t \quad \quad \text{for some }t_i^*\in[t_{i-1},t_i] 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This approximation is step one of our classic calculus approach and sets ourselves up well for step 2.</div>
<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#accumulation-2-4" title="Copy permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For step 2 of our classic calculus approach, we will need to understand how this approximation will work on a finer scale. A finer scale in this case means a larger number of subintervals (<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) which means that <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> gets smaller. In other words, a finer scale means more terms in our sum but a smaller step size multiplier (<span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span>). Our estimate becomes a Riemann sum where the function being evaluated in the Riemann sum is the velocity of the object. Recognizing this means that we can use our knowledge of how limits of Riemann sums become definite integrals to do step three of our classic calculus approach. So as <span class="process-math">\(n\rightarrow \infty\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\text{,}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x_0+\sum_{i=1}^n v(t_i^*) \Delta t \Rightarrow x(a)=x_0+\int_0^{a} v(t) \enspace dt
\end{equation*}

<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#accumulation-2-5" title="Copy permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In practice, this approximation is what GPS systems do a very fine level; namely, use hyper-accurate timing and changes in distances to satellites to give current position. Accumulation will also apply to many situations when working with the density of a material as well. For instance, if you drive a mining machine that harvests a mineral from the surface, the amount you harvest is going to be the accumulation of the different densities of the mineral along the path you drove. Mathematically this looks like</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\text{total harvested} \amp= \sum \text{amount in each section driven} \\
\amp\approx \sum (\text{density}) (\text{length of the section}) 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">where this Riemann sum becomes a definite integral of the density function. This idea of accumulation of a function is something we will use in most chapters from here out, so we will return to these ideas as they are needed. You can look at Chapter 5 of Active Calculus for activities involving accumulation as well as ideas like antiderivatives and indefinite integrals as a functional generalization of integration.</div>
