<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">In this activity, we will use a function corresponding to elevation (as a function of 2D location) to explore what properties a point corresponding to a local maximum or local minimum (of a function of two variables) must have. Similar to <a href="S-10-6-Directional-Derivative.html#foggymtn1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/foggymtn1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Activity 11.7.5">Activity 11.7.5</a>, we are hiking in a foggy park and cannot see anything more than a few feet in front of us. There is nothing blocking us from walking in any particular direction but because of the fog we cannot see where the highest point on the mountain is. We want to try to find the top of the mountain, but we don’t have a map or trail or any line of sight to other landmarks. Our compass still works in the fog, so we can tell what direction North/South/East/West are.</div>
<div class="para">We also brought a level that we can place on the ground at our feet to measure how steep the change in elevation will be in a particular direction. In other words, the level can measure the directional derivative at our current location. Conceptually, we want to understand how the measurements we can take with our level will allow us to identify when we have reached the top of the mountain.</div>

We want to state some conditions for our measurement using the level that will determine if we have reached the top of the mountain.</div> <div class="para">Suppose you are actually standing at the top of the mountain (which will correspond to a local maximum for the elevation) and you set the level at your feet in the East direction.
