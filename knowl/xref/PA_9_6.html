<div class="introduction"><div class="para">After graduating, you decide to start a self driving car company because it didn’t look too hard based on a few articles you scrolled past online. You decide to call your company <em class="emphasis">Steer Clear</em> and start working on the self driving part of the car. Your first task is to understand how the location tracking equipment you bought online works. There are two parts to your location tracking system. A receiver box and a tracker that you put in the object you want to track.</div></div>

<div class="para">After putting the tracker in your pocket, you get in a car and drive around the receiver box. When you download the data about your drive, you notice that the software is outputting a vector from the receiver box to the tracker. The software also seems to love math, because these vectors are written in terms of trig functions.</div> <div class="para logical">
