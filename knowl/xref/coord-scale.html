<div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">While walking your dog, you notice that your dog takes three steps for every step of yours. When you sit down at home you realize that your coordinate system for your house is different than your dog’s. You decide to make the origin of both your coordinate system and your dog’s to be the entrance to your kitchen. Your dog’s bed is eight of your steps south and four steps west of the entrance to the kitchen. The dog’s water bowl is 5 of your steps north and 3 steps east from the entrace to your kitchen. The front door of your house is 15 of your steps south and 9 steps east of the entrance to the kitchen.</div> <div xmlns:pf="https://prefigure.org" class="para">Draw a set of axes and plot the location of your dog’s bed, water bowl, and the front door in terms of your steps from the origin (the entrance to your kitchen).</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
