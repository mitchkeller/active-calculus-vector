<p>It's common for weather forecasters to discuss the wind <dfn class="terminology">speed</dfn>, but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at <span class="quantity">10 <sup>km</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>h</sub></span> without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing. If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. (Perhaps you are taking off in a hot air balloon and need to know which direction the chase team should head to keep track of you.) Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind <dfn class="terminology">velocity</dfn> at every point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).</p>
