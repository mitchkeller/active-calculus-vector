<p>SOLUTION</p> <p>1. The vectors of the radial vector field are perpendicular to the curve. Thus the line integral is zero.</p> <p>2. The vector field points in the opposite direction as the curve. Thus the line integral is negative.</p> <p>3. The vector field points in the same direction as the curve. Thus the line integral is positive.</p> <p>4. The line integral in the first quadrant counterbalances the line integral in the second quadrant. Thus the line integral along the semicircle is zero.</p> <p>5. The line integral in the first quadrant counterbalances the line integral in the second quadrant. Thus the line integral along the semicircle is zero.</p> <p>6. The vectors point generally in the same direction as the curve. Thus the line integral is positive.</p>
