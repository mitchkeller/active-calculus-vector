<div class="para">Vectors do not have a particular starting or ending point. However, it will be useful to use directed line segments like <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{AB}\)</span> as a specific representative of a vector. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle 3, 4\rangle\text{,}\)</span> which represents a horizontal change of (positive) three units and a vertical change of (positive) four units. We may place the <dfn class="terminology">tail</dfn> of the vector (the point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the <dfn class="terminology">tip</dfn> (the terminal point of the vector) at <span class="process-math">\((3,4)\text{,}\)</span> as illustrated in <a href="S-Precalc-Vectors.html#F-Precalc-vectors-standard-origin" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/F-Precalc-vectors-standard-origin.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 9.2.3.(a)">FigureÂ 9.2.3.(a)</a>. A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in <dfn class="terminology">standard position</dfn>.</div>
