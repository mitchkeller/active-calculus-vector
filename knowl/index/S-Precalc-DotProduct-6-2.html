<div class="para">Many important relationships between vectors arise when the angle between two vectors is a right angle. In this case, we say the vectors are <dfn class="terminology">orthogonal</dfn>.  For instance, orthogonality often plays a role in optimization problems: to determine the shortest path from a point in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> to a given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to the plane. From your prior mathematical experience, you are likely familiar with saying that two objects that form a right angle are <em class="emphasis">perpendicular</em>. When vectors are involved, we prefer to use the term <em class="emphasis">orthogonal</em> because it allows for one (or both) of the vectors to be <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\text{,}\)</span> which is a case where we would not say the vectors are perpendicular.</div>
