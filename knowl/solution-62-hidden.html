Since <span class="process-math">\(p(x,y)=0\)</span> outside the region <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> the volume under the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is the same as the volume under the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> over the region <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(9\text{,}\)</span> . Finally, for a constant function to be a joint density function on <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> given by <span class="process-math">\(0 \le x \le 2,
0 \le y \le 3\text{,}\)</span> the volume under the constant must be one.  So, if <span class="process-math">\(p(x,y) = k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(6 k = 1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(p(x,y) = \frac1{6}\text{.}\)</span>
