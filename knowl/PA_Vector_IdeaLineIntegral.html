<div class="introduction"><p>Recall from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "S-9-3-Dot-Product" missing or not unique]</code> that the work done by a force <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> on an object that moves with displacement vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\vF\cdot \vv\text{.}\)</span>  In this Preview Activity, we consider the work done by a wind blowing due east at <span class="quantity">45 <sup>mi</sup>⁄<sub>h</sub></span> on an airplane at various stages of its journey.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<p>A pilot flies for an hour and finds that he is <span class="quantity">300 mi</span> from where he started at a heading of <span class="quantity">20 °</span> degrees east of due north.  Find the work the wind has done on the airplane during the flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>An hour later, the pilot determines that he is <span class="quantity">275 mi</span> due north of where he previously checked his position. Find the work done by the wind on the airplane during the second hour of the flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>Find the pilot's displacement from his original position after two hours of flying and use that to find the work done by the wind on the airplane during the first two hours of flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>How does your answer to the previous part connect to the answers to the first two parts?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>Suppose that the pilot then flies <span class="quantity">45 °</span> west of due north for <span class="quantity">200 mi</span>.  Find the work done by the wind on the airplane during this part of the journey.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral.html#PA_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
