<p>As we discussed in <a href="S_Vector_VectorFields.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.1: Vector Fields">Section 9.1</a>, vector fields are often useful as representations of forces such as gravity, wind, and flowing water.  We learned in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "S-9-3-Dot-Product" missing or not unique]</code> that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail of its displacement vector to the tip.  However, things get more complicated when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.  For example, how much work is done by a wind of <span class="quantity">30 <sup>mi</sup>⁄<sub>h</sub></span> toward the northwest on an airplane that's flying <span class="quantity">500 mi</span> due north?  What if the wind gets weaker the farther north the plane gets?  In this section, we begin investigating how integration can be used to calculate the work a force field does in such circumstances.</p>
