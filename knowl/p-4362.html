<div class="para">Thus far vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus.  We know how to do operations on vectors (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span>  The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function.  That is, a curve <span class="process-math">\(\vr(t)\)</span> is a function that takes as input a real number and produces a vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span>  In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take as input a point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or a point <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> and produce a vector (typically in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> respectively).</div>
