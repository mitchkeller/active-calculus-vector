    <p>
      Position is the central measurement of the study of motion, which is known as kinematics. Velocity and acceleration are the first and second derivatives of position, respectively, and are frequently important properties in the study of physics and mechanics. To better understand velocity as a vector-valued function of time, we examined how the magnitude and direction of position change separately. We separated velocity into its critical parts: speed (magnitude of velocity) and direction of travel (unit tangent vector). Speed is a scalar measurement for how fast the position of an object is changing as a function of time, while <m>\vT</m> is a unit vector that measures the direction in which position is changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a vector quantity, acceleration is related to many important physical laws and descriptions. For example, Newton's Second Law of Motion relates the forces acting on an object to its acceleration through the formula <m> \vec{F}_{net}= m \vec{a}</m>. This is often summarized as the sum of the forces acting on an object is the mass times the acceleration of the object. This description relates a combination of forces on a object to its position and velocity through integration of <m>\va</m>. For an example of these calculations, refer back to <xref ref="projectilemotion" />. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand acceleration better as a vector quantity, we will examine acceleration as a change in the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. In this section, we will use our knowledge of calculus and vector measurements to split the acceleration vector into parts related to the changes in the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. We will also consider how these measurements relate to physical contexts.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        All your good work as CEO and lead engineer at <em>Steer Clear</em> has started to pay off, literally. When you showed your work on using the location tracking system (LTS) to develop navigation and telemetry tools to an investment group (your grandparents), they were impressed and decided to give you money to further develop your self-driving car. You decided to use this infusion of cash to buy a gyroscopic accelerometer which will measure acceleration as a vector with magnitude and direction. In order to use your new instrument for information on the <q>driving</q> part of your self-driving car, you need to understand how your accelerometer readings will relate to the operations needed to drive a car.

    The preview activity shows how you can graphically separate the acceleration vector into parts in the direction of travel and direction of turning. In this section, we will look at how to calculate these separate parts algebraically, understand what is being measured by these quantities, and show how these tools will give us important physical measurements as well as an efficient tool for calculating <m>\vN</m>, the unit normal vector to a curve.

  <title>Splitting Acceleration</title>
  <p>
    Recall that by <xref ref="def-unit-tangent" text="custom">the definition of <m>\vT</m></xref>, <m>\vv</m> is parallel to <m>\vT</m> when <m>\vv</m> exists and is nonzero. Additionally, <xref ref="TdotNzero"/> states that <m>\vT \cdot \vN =0 </m>. In other words, <em>all</em> of the velocity is in a direction parallel to the unit tangent vector and the unit normal vector is <em>always</em> orthogonal to the unit tangent vector to a curve, when they exist. In this subsection, we will look at splitting the acceleration vector into parts in the direction of travel and the direction of turning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose <m>\va(t)</m> is the acceleration vector for the motion along a curve in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>. From <xref ref="S-VVF-TNB" />, we have the TNB frame as a way of describing key directions related to motion along a curve in space. We would like to split the acceleration vector into a part in each of directions corresponding to <m>\vT</m>, <m>\vN</m>, and <m>\vB</m>. Algebraically, we want to find scalars <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>, and <m>c_3</m> such that <m>\va= c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB</m>. To do so, we will make use of several key facts from <xref ref="S-VVF-TNB" />:
    <md>
      <mrow> \vT \cdot \vN \amp=0 \amp \vT \cdot \vB \amp =0 \amp \vN \cdot \vB \amp=0 \amp\vecmag{\vT}\amp=\vecmag{\vN}=\vecmag{\vB}=1</mrow>
    </md>. If we compute the dot product of each of <m>\vT</m>, <m>\vN</m>, and <m>\vB</m> with the expression for <m>\va</m>, we find
    <md>
      <mrow>\va \cdot \vT \amp= (c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB)\cdot \vT </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= c_1 (\vT \cdot \vT) + c_2 (\vN \cdot \vT) +c_3 (\vB \cdot \vT) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp=c_1 </mrow>
      <mrow>\va \cdot \vN \amp= (c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB)\cdot \vN </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= c_1 (\vT \cdot \vN) + c_2 (\vN \cdot \vN) +c_3 (\vB \cdot \vN) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp=c_2 </mrow>
      <mrow>\va \cdot \vB \amp= (c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB)\cdot \vB </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= c_1 (\vT \cdot \vB) + c_2 (\vN \cdot \vB) +c_3 (\vB \cdot \vB) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp=c_3 </mrow>
    </md>
    These computations demonstrate that because the TNB frame directions are all unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other, we can compute the amount of acceleration in each of these directions with a dot product!
 </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-aTaN">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>tangential component of acceleration</term> is <m>a_{\vT} = \va \cdot \vT </m> and the <term>normal component of acceleration</term> is <m>a_{\vN} = \va \cdot \vN </m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Our use of the word <q>component</q> in <xref ref="def-aTaN"/> is consistent with our use in <xref ref="S-Precalc-DotProduct" />  because <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are both unit vectors. Furthermore, because the unit tangent and unit normal vectors are also orthogonal to each other, <m>a_{\vT}</m> and  <m>a_{\vN}</m> give the amount of acceleration in the direction of travel and the direction of turning, respectively. You may notice that we only gave names for acceleration in the tangential and normal directions above. The acceleration vector for motion along a curve can <em>only</em> have components in the tangential and normal directions to the curve. It is not possible for the acceleration vector of parameterized curve to have any component in a direction, such as that of <m>\vB</m>, that does not lie in the plane defined by <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>, which we state formally and justify below.
  </p>
  
  <proposition xml:id="prop-aTaN">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\va(t)</m> is the acceleration vector for a parameterization of a curve in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, then
        <me>\va=a_{\vT} \vT + a_{\vN} \vN</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We claim that the scalar <m>a_{\vN}</m> measures the acceleration due to change in the direction of <m>\vv</m> and the scalar <m>a_{\vT}</m> measures the acceleration due to the change in magnitude of <m>\vv</m>. This interpretation of <m>a_{\vT}</m> and <m>a_{\vN}</m> follows from a product rule argument based on how we split the velocity vector into speed (magnitude) and <m>\vT</m> (direction). We start by splitting velocity into its direction and magnitude:
        <me> \vv(t) = \text{speed}(t) \cdot \vT(t) </me>
        Taking the derivative of the velocity using a product rule, we get the following formula for  acceleration:
        <me> \va(t) = \frac{d\vv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\text{speed}) \cdot \vT + (\text{speed}) \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(\vT)</me>
        We can rearrange the terms in our definition for <m>\vN</m> to solve for <m>\vT\, '(t)</m>, which gives
        <me>\vN=\frac{\vT\, '}{\vecmag{\vT\, '}} \Rightarrow \vT\, '= \vecmag{\vT'} \vN </me>.
        Applying this to our acceleration equation above, we get
        <men xml:id="algsplita" >\va(t) = \frac{d\vv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\text{speed}) \cdot \vT + (\text{speed}) \cdot \vecmag{\frac{d\vT}{dt}} \vN </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This algebraic splitting of acceleration gives a nice way to interpret <m>a_{\vT}</m>. Specifically, <m>a_{\vT}</m> is the rate of change of speed!
      </p>
      <p>
        The scalar <m>a_{\vN}</m> is harder to interpret right now because our algebraic splitting shows that <m>a_{\vN} = (\text{speed}) \vecmag{\frac{d\vT}{dt}}</m>. Since <m> \frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> and <m> \vecmag{\frac{d\vT}{dt}}</m> are as hard to calculate directly as <m>\vN</m> is, we do not have an intuitive interpretation for the meaning of <m>a_{\vN}</m>. We will return to the meaning of <m>a_{\vN}</m> later in this section, but for now you should think of <m>a_{\vN}</m> as the acceleration due to a change in the direction of the velocity vector. In other words, <m>a_{\vN}</m> is the amount of acceleration due to turning. 
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    Note that nothing in the argument for <xref ref="prop-aTaN" /> depended on being in three dimensions, and all of the calculus tools used in the argument work for any <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.

  <definition xml:id="def-splita">

        The <term>splitting of the acceleration (vector)</term> refers to finding scalars  <m>a_{\vT}</m> and <m>a_{\vN}</m> such that <m> \va = a_{\vT} \vT + a_{\vN} \vN</m>. This allows us to describe the amount of the acceleration that is in the unit tangent direction and the amount that is in the unit normal direction, relative to the motion on the curve.

    You saw in <xref ref="difficult-calcN"/> that calculating <m>\vN</m> for even a curve with a very <q>nice</q> parameterization algebraically using the definition requires extensive algebraic manipulation. Before going into an exampmle of the computations involved in splitting the acceleration vector, we will identify a relationship of the vectors involved in splitting the acceleration vector that yields another way of approaching <m>\vN</m>. To do this, we consider the right triangle of vectors in <xref ref="RTsplita" />. If we apply the Pythagorean Theorem to this right triangle, we can then use that the unit tangent vector and unit normal vector both have length one to conclude that <m> \vecmag{ \va }^2 =(a_{\vT})^2+(a_{\vN})^2</m>.

    Now we can solve for <m>a_{\vN}</m> and find 
    <men xml:id="eqn-accel-normal">a_{\vN}= \sqrt{\vecmag{\va}^2 - (a_{\vT})^2}
    </men>.
    Notice that since <m>a_{\vN}</m> is <em>always</em> nonnegative, we know that we can take the positive square root when solving here. We will soon use this formula to help find <m>a_{\vN}</m>. Since <m>\va = a_{\vT}\vT + a_{\vN}\vN</m>, we can also solve for <m>\vN</m> and have
    <me>
      \vN = \frac{\va-a_{\vT}\vT}{a_{\vN}},
    </me>
    which we will use to help find <m>\vN</m>.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this example we find the splitting of acceleration for a curve parameterized by <m>\vr(t)=\langle t, t^2,t^3\rangle</m> with <m>0\leq t\leq 2</m>. While this curve's parameterization is simple algebraically, we will find that the formulas involved in the splitting of acceleration become more complex fairly quickly. To get started, we will find the splitting of the acceleration vector for a single parameter value. In the second step, we will look at finding general formulas for <m>a_{\vT}</m> and <m>a_{\vN}</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In many circumstances, we need to compute the splitting of acceleration for only one parameter value. For this example, we will look at how clean the computations can be if we want to look only at <m>t=1</m>. The first steps for calculating <m>\vv</m> and <m>\va</m> are to use the definitions and substitute <m>t=1</m>
          <md>
            <mrow>\vr(t) \amp=\langle t, t^2,t^3\rangle \amp \vr(1) \amp=\langle 1, 1, 1 \rangle </mrow>
            <mrow>\vv(t) \amp=\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle \amp \vv(1) \amp=\langle 1, 2, 4 \rangle</mrow>
            <mrow>\va(t) \amp=\langle 0, 2,6t\rangle \amp \va(1) \amp=\langle 0, 2, 6 \rangle</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next quantity to calculate is <m>\vT</m>. Note that <me>\text{speed}(1)=\vecmag{\vv(1)}= \sqrt{1+4+9}=\sqrt{14}</me> here. Thus,
          <me>\vT(1) = \frac{\vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}  = \frac{\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle}{\sqrt{14}} </me>.
          This allows us to calculate <m>a_{\vT}(1)</m>  from the definition
          <md>
            <mrow> a_{\vT}(1) = \va(1) \cdot \vT(1) \amp= \langle 0, 2, 6 \rangle \cdot \frac{\langle 1, 2 , 3 \rangle}{\sqrt{14}} </mrow>
            <mrow>                       \amp= \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left(1(0)+2(2)+3(6)\right)= \frac{22}{\sqrt{14}}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now use <m>a_{\vN}(1) = \sqrt{\vecmag{ \va(1) }^2  -(a_{\vT}(1))^2}</m> to efficiently calculate the normal component of the acceleration and have
          <md>
            <mrow> a_{\vN}(1)  \amp= \sqrt{\vecmag{ \va(1) }^2  -(a_{\vT}(1))^2} = \sqrt{\frac{76}{14}} = \sqrt{\frac{38}{7}} </mrow>
            <!-- <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{(40)- \left(\frac{22}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2}</mrow> -->
            <!-- <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{\frac{560}{14}-\frac{22^2}{14}}</mrow> -->
            <!-- <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{\frac{76}{14}}</mrow> -->
          </md>.
          We can now compute how much acceleration there is due to turning and use that to explicitly compute <m>\vN(1)</m>. We have
          <md>
            <mrow> a_{\vN}(1) \vN(1) \amp= \va(1) - a_{\vT}(1) \vT(1) </mrow>
            <mrow>           \amp= \langle 0, 2,6 \rangle - \frac{22}{\sqrt{14}} \frac{\langle 1, 2, 3\rangle}{\sqrt{14}}</mrow>

          </md>.
          Thus, 
          <me> \vN = \frac{\va - a_{\vT} \vT}{a_{\vN}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{38}} \left\langle -\frac{11}{7},-\frac{16}{7},\frac{9}{7} \right\rangle</me>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          We now consider splitting the acceleration vector for the same curve, but we do so for an arbitrary parameter value <m>t</m>. That is, we will calculate <m>\vv</m>, <m>\va</m>, <m>\vT</m>, <m>a_{\vT}</m>, <m>a_{\vN}</m>, and <m>\vN</m> as functions of <m>t</m>. Along the way, we will omit a number of straightforward steps in simplifying. Since we already calculated <m>\vr(t)</m>, <m>\vv(t)</m>, and <m>\va(t)</m> in the previous part, we can move on to calculate <m>\vT</m>. Since <m>\text{speed}(t)=\vecmag{\vv(t)}</m>, we have <m>\text{speed}(t)= \sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}</m> here. Thus,
        <me> \vT(t) = \frac{\vv}{\vecmag{\vv}} = \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</me>.
        The definition <m>a_{\vT} = \va \cdot \vT</m> allows us to calculate <m>a_{\vT}</m>:

          <mrow> a_{\vT} = \va \cdot \vT \amp= \langle 0, 2,6t\rangle \cdot \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}} </mrow>

        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this parameterization,

          <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{(4+36t^2)- \left(\frac{4t+18t^3}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}\right)^2}</mrow>

        </md>.
        We can now also calculate <m>\vN</m> as a function of <m>t</m> without having to go through the complex algebra required to compute <m>\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m>. We have
        <md>
          <mrow> a_{\vN} \vN \amp= \va - a_{\vT} \vT </mrow>
          <mrow>           \amp= \langle 0, 2,6t \rangle - \frac{4t+18t^3}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}} \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</mrow>
        </md>,
        so we can write <m>\vN</m> as 
        <md> 
          <mrow> \vN \amp= \frac{\va - a_{\vT} \vT}{a_{\vN}}</mrow>

        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this process is still algebraically tedious, these steps are less difficult than finding <m>\vN</m> directly (as in <xref ref="difficult-calcN" />). We also now have insight into how the acceleration is split in the direction of travel and direction of turning. Graphically, we can represent this splitting with <xref ref="splita-ex1"/>.

    <xref ref="splita-howtochange" text="type-local" />, <xref ref="splita-travelmeanings" text="type-local" />, and  <xref ref="splita-visual" text="type-local" /> offer conceptual and physical meaning to the different measurements involved in the splitting of acceleration. We will take a moment now to relate <m>a_{\vN}</m>, the acceleration due to a change in the direction of travel, and <m>\kappa</m>, the curvature, which measures rate of change for the direction of travel on a curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous statement may seem a bit like we said the same thing twice, but <m>a_{\vN}</m> and <m>\kappa</m> are <em>not</em> the same. 
    <xref ref="thm-calc-curvature"/> shows that 
    <me>\kappa  = \frac{\vecmag{ \frac{d\vT}{dt} }}{ \vecmag{ \vr\, '(t) }}</me>.
    We can solve for <m>\vecmag{ \frac{d\vT}{dt} }</m> in terms of <m>\kappa</m> to get <m>\vecmag{ \frac{d\vT}{dt} }= \kappa \cdot \text{speed}</m>.
    We saw earlier in this section that 
    <me>a_{\vN}= \text{speed}\cdot  \vecmag{\frac{d\vT}{dt}}</me>
    Thus, we can write <m>a_{\vN}</m> in terms of speed and curvature as 
    <men xml:id="kaN"> a_{\vN}=\kappa\cdot (\text{speed})^2 </men>.
    Equation <xref ref="kaN" /> helps demonstrate the difference between <m>a_{\vN}</m> and <m>\kappa</m>. Specifically, <m>\kappa</m> measures how fast the path is curving and <m>a_{\vN}</m>, the normal component of acceleration, measures the acceleration felt due to turning. Equation <xref ref="kaN" /> shows that if two drivers are driving along the same road but the first driver is going twice as fast as the second driver is going, then the first driver feels <em>four times</em> as much acceleration due to turning  as the second driver does, even though both drivers are following the exact same road. Curvature is how fast the <em>road</em> is turning and <m>a_{\vN}</m> is how fast it feels like the driver is turning based on speed, which is determined by the parameterization.
