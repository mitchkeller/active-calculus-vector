  <introduction>
    <p>
      Position is the central measurement of kinematics, the study of motion. Velocity and acceleration are the first and second derivatives of position, respectively and often serve as vital properties in the study of physics and mechanics. To better understand velocity as a vector valued function of time, we examined how the magnitude and direction of position change separately. In particular, we separated velocity into its critical parts, namely speed (magnitude of velocity) and unit tangent vector (direction of travel). Speed is a scalar measurement for how fast the position of an object is changing as a function of time and <m>\vT</m> is a unit vector that measures in what direction position is changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acceleration (as a vector quantity) is related to many important physical laws and descriptions. For example, Newton's Second Law of Motion relates the forces acting on an object to its acceleration through the formula <m> \vec{F}_{net}= m \vec{a}</m>. This is often summarized as the sum of the forces acting on an object is the mass times the acceleration of the object. This description relates a combination of forces on a object to the position and velocity (through integration of <m>\va</m>). For a basic example of these calculations look at <xref ref="projectilemotion" />. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to understand acceleration better as a vector quantity, we will examine acceleration as a change in the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. In this section, we will use our knowledge of calculus and vector measurements to split the acceleration vector into parts related to the changes in the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector. Further, we will make sense of these different measurements as they relate to physical contexts.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        All your good work as CEO and lead engineer at <em>Steer Clear</em> has started to pay off, literally. When you showed your work on using the location tracking system (LTS) to develop navigation and telemetry tools to an investment group (your grandparents), they were impressed and decided to give you money to further develop your self driving car. You decided to use this new infusion of cash to buy a gyroscopic accelerometer which will measure the acceleration as a vector with magnitude and direction. In order to use your new instrument for information on the <q>driving</q> part of our self-driving car, you need to understand how your accelerometer readings will relate to the operations needed to drive a car.

    The preview activity shows how you can graphically separate the acceleration vector into parts in the direction of travel and direction of turning. In this section, we will look at how to calculate these separate parts algebraically, understand what is being measured by these quantities, and show how these tools will give us important physical measurements as well as an efficient tool for calculating <m>\vN</m>, the unit normal vector to a curve.
  </p>
</introduction>
<subsection>
  <title>Splitting Acceleration</title>
  <p>
    Recall that by <xref ref="def-T" text="custom">the definition of <m>\vT</m></xref>, <m>\vv</m> is parallel to <m>\vT</m> (when <m>\vv</m> is not the zero vector or DNE) and as <xref ref="TdotNzero" text="custom">a consequence of how <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are defined</xref>, <m>\vT \cdot \vN =0 </m>. In other words, ALL of the velocity is in a direction parallel to the unit tangent vector and the unit normal is <em>always</em> orthogonal to the unit tangent to a curve (when they exist). In this subsection, we will look at splitting the acceleration vector into parts in the direction of travel and the direction of turning.
  </p>
  <p>
    For right now, let's suppose that we have the acceleration vector, <m>\va(t)</m>, for the motion along some curve in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>. From <xref ref="S-VVF-TNB" />, we have the TNB frame as a way of describing key directions related to motion along a curve in space. We would like to split the acceleration vector up into parts in each of these directions (<m>\vT</m>, <m>\vN</m>, and <m>\vB</m>). In particular, we want to find <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>, and <m>c_3</m> such that <m>\va= c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB</m>. Remember that <m>\vT \cdot \vN =0</m>, <m>\vT \cdot \vB =0</m>, <m>\vN \cdot \vB =0</m>, and <m>\vecmag{\vT}=\vecmag{\vN}=\vecmag{\vB}=1</m>. We can take the dot product of each of <m>\vT</m>, <m>\vN</m>, and <m>\vB</m> with our expression for <m>\va</m> to get the following:
    <md>
      <mrow>\va \cdot \vT \amp= (c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB)\cdot \vT </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= c_1 (\vT \cdot \vT) + c_2 (\vN \cdot \vT) +c_3 (\vB \cdot \vT) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp=c_1 </mrow>
      <mrow>\va \cdot \vN \amp= (c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB)\cdot \vN </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= c_1 (\vT \cdot \vN) + c_2 (\vN \cdot \vN) +c_3 (\vB \cdot \vN) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp=c_2 </mrow>
      <mrow>\va \cdot \vB \amp= (c_1 \vT + c_2 \vN +c_3 \vB)\cdot \vB </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= c_1 (\vT \cdot \vB) + c_2 (\vN \cdot \vB) +c_3 (\vB \cdot \vB) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp=c_3 </mrow>
    </md>
    Because we our TNB frame directions are all orthogonal to each other and unit vectors, we can compute the amount of acceleration in each of these directions with a dot product!
 </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-aTaN">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>tangential component of acceleration</term> is defined as <m>a_{\vT} = \va \cdot \vT </m> and the <term>normal component of acceleration</term> is defined as <m>a_{\vN} = \va \cdot \vN </m>. Because <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal to each other and unit vectors, <m>a_{\vT}</m> and  <m>a_{\vN}</m> will give the amount of acceleration in the direction of travel and the direction of turning, respectively. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    You may notice that we only gave names for the accelerations in the tangential and normal directions above. It turns out that the acceleration vector for motion along a curve can <em>only</em> have components in the tangential and normal directions to the curve. It is not possible for the acceleration vector of parameterized curve to have any component in another direction (like <m>\vB</m>).
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="prop-aTaN">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\va(t)</m> is the acceleration vector for a parameterization of a curve in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, then
        <me>\va=a_{\vT} \vT + a_{\vN} \vN</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We claim that the scalar <m>a_{\vN}</m> measures the acceleration due to change in the direction of <m>\vv</m> and the scalar <m>a_{\vT}</m> measures the acceleration due to the change in magnitude of <m>\vv</m>. This interpretation of <m>a_{\vT}</m> and <m>a_{\vN}</m> follows from a neat product rule argument based on how we split the velocity vector into speed (magnitude) and <m>\vT</m> (direction). We start by splitting velocity into its direction and magnitude.
        <me> \vv(t) = \text{speed}(t) \enspace \vT(t) </me>
        Taking the derivative of the velocity using a product rule, we get the following for the acceleration.
        <me> \va(t) = \frac{d\vv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\text{speed}) \enspace \vT + (\text{speed}) \enspace \frac{d}{dt}(\vT)</me>
        We can rearrange the terms in our definition for <m>\vN</m> to solve for <m>\vT'(t)</m>.
        <me>\vN=\frac{\vT'}{\Vert\vT'\Vert} \Rightarrow \vT'= \Vert\vT'\Vert \vN </me>
        Applying this to our acceleration equation above, we get
        <men xml:id="algsplita" >\va(t) = \frac{d\vv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\text{speed}) \enspace \vT + (\text{speed}) \enspace \left\Vert{\frac{d\vT}{dt}}\right\Vert \vN </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        This algebraic splitting of acceleration gives a nice way to interpret <m>a_{\vT}</m>. Specifically, <m>a_{\vT}</m> is the rate of change of speed!
      </p>
      <p>
        The scalar <m>a_{\vN}</m> is harder to interpret right now because our algebraic splitting shows that <m>a_{\vN} = (\text{speed}) \Vert\frac{d\vT}{dt}\Vert</m>. Because <m> \frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> and <m> \Vert\frac{d\vT}{dt}\Vert</m> are just as hard to calculate as <m>\vN</m> directly (which is awful as shown in <xref ref="difficult-calcN" />), we do not have a great interpretation for the meaning of <m>a_{\vN}</m>. We will return to the meaning of <m>a_{\vN}</m> later in this section, but for now you should think of <m>a_{\vN}</m> as the acceleration due to a change in the direction of the velocity vector. In other words, <m>a_{\vN}</m> is the amount of acceleration due to turning. 
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    Note that nothing in the argument for <xref ref="prop-aTaN" /> depended on being in three dimensions and all of our calculus tools used work for any <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>. 
  </p>
  
  <definition xml:id="def-splita">
    <statement>
      <p>
        When we refer to the <term>splitting of the acceleration (vector)</term>, we mean that we want to explicitly describe how much of the acceleration is in the unit tangent direction and how much is in the unit normal direction (relative to the motion on the curve).
      </p> 
      <p> 
        In particular, we want to find <m>a_{\vT}</m> and <m>a_{\vN}</m> such that <m> \va = a_{\vT} \vT + a_{\vN} \vN</m>. <xref ref="splita-graph"/> shows graphically what this splitting looks like. You can use the slider at the top of the interact to change the location on the curve where the splitting of the acceleration is shown. You should look at different points along the curve to see how each of <m>\vT</m>, <m>\vN</m>, <m>a_{\vT}</m>, and <m>a_{\vN}</m> change at different locations. The vector <m>a_{\vN} \vN</m> is drawn twice to demonstrate it's relationship to <m>\vN</m> and how <m>\va</m> is a vector sum of <m>a_{\vT} \vT</m> and <m>a_{\vN} \vN</m>.

    <xref ref="splita-howtochange" /> and <xref ref="splita-travelmeanings" /> relate the scalar and vector measurements involved in the splitting of acceleration to different modes of transportation and looks at how different actions (when riding a bike or driving a car) will affect these vector calculus quantities. In <xref ref="splita-visual" />, we will look at how to visually identify the different measurements involved the splitting of the acceleration vector.
  </p>  
  <example>
    <task>
      <p>
        In this example we will look at the splitting of acceleration for an algebraically simple curve parameterized by <m>\vr(t)=\langle t, t^2,t^3\rangle</m> as <m>t</m> goes from 0 to 2. We will first look at calculating the splitting of acceleration for all <m>t</m>-values in our interval. In particular, we will calculate <m>\vv</m>, <m>\va</m>, <m>\vT</m>, <m>a_{\vT}</m>, <m>a_{\vN}</m>, and <m>\vN</m> as functions of <m>t</m>. The calculation of the velocity and acceleration are generally speaking the most familiar.

          <mrow>\vr(t) \amp=\langle t, t^2,t^3\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow>\vv(t) \amp=\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow>\va(t) \amp=\langle 0, 2,6t\rangle </mrow>
        </md>
        As this example will show, it is possible to state each of our other calculations in terms of velocity and acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next quantity to calculate is <m>\vT</m>. Note that <m>\text{speed}(t)=\Vert\vv(t)\Vert= \sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}</m> for our example.
        <me> \vT(t) = \frac{\vv}{\Vert\vv\Vert} = \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</me>
        This will allow us to calculate <m>a_{\vT}</m> next from the definition <m>a_{\vT} = \va \cdot \vT</m>
        <md>
          <mrow> a_{\vT} = \va \cdot \vT \amp= \langle 0, 2,6t\rangle \cdot \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}} </mrow>
          <mrow>                       \amp= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}} \left(1(0)+2(2t)+6t(3t^2)\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>                       \amp= \frac{4t+18t^3}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</mrow>
        </md> 
      </p>
      <p>
        So far in this example, we have used the definitions to calculate both <m>\vT</m> and <m>a_{\vT}</m>, but <m>\vN</m> is quite difficult to calculate using the definition. In fact, we gave up trying to use the defintion when calculating <m>\vN</m> in <xref ref="difficult-calcN"/>.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Our next couple of steps will use some vector calculations related to <xref ref="def-splita" />. Because the unit tangent and unit normal vectors are both length one and are orthogonal to each other, then <m> \Vert \va \Vert^2 =(a_{\vT})^2+(a_{\vN})^2</m>. This equation comes from a Pythagorean Theorem argument as shown by the right triangle of vectors in <xref ref="RTsplita" />

        In particular, we can solve for <m>a_{\vN}= \sqrt{\Vert \va \Vert^2  -(a_{\vT})^2}</m> which will not require an interpretation of positive/negative because <m>a_{\vN}</m> will <em>always</em> be non-negative. 
        For our example,
        <md>
          <mrow> a_{\vN}   \amp= \sqrt{\Vert \va \Vert^2  -(a_{\vT})^2} </mrow>
          <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{(4+36t^2)- \left(\frac{4t+18t^3}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}\right)^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{(4+36t^2)- \frac{(4t+18t^3)^2}{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</mrow>
          <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{\frac{(1+4t^2+9t^4)(4+36t^2)-(4t+18t^3)^2}{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</mrow>
          <mrow>           \amp= \sqrt{\frac{4(9t^4+9t^2+1)}{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</mrow>
        </md>
        Note how we were able to find the acceleration in the normal direction (<m>a_{\vN} \vN</m>) by subtracting out the acceleration in the tangential direction. Our calculation above utilizes that <m>a_{\vN}</m> is the length of this acceleration in the normal direction. The other side to this is that we can calculate <m>\vN</m> as a function of <m>t</m> without having to go through the difficulties involved in <m>\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m>. Specifically, <m>a_{\vN} \vN = \va - a_{\vT} \vT</m> implies that <m> \vN = \frac{\va - a_{\vT} \vT}{a_{\vN}}</m>. This is hugely useful because we were able to calculate everything on the right side of this equation in terms of <m>\vv</m> and <m>\va</m>. For our example, 
        <md>
          <mrow> a_{\vN} \vN \amp= \va - a_{\vT} \vT </mrow>
          <mrow>           \amp= \langle 0, 2,6t \rangle - \frac{4t+18t^3}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}} \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}</mrow>
        </md>
        Thus we can write <m>\vN</m> as 
        <md> 
          <mrow> \vN \amp= \frac{\va - a_{\vT} \vT}{a_{\vN}}</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \sqrt{\frac{1+4t^2+9t^4}{4(9t^4+9t^2+1)}}\left(\langle 0, 2,6t \rangle - \frac{4t+18t^3}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}} \frac{\langle 1, 2t,3t^2\rangle}{\sqrt{1+4t^2+9t^4}}\right)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        While this process may seem a bit algebraically tedious, these steps are much less difficult than finding <m>\vN</m> directly (as in <xref ref="difficult-calcN" />) AND we get insight into how the acceleration is split in the direction of travel and direction of turning. Graphically, we can represent this splitting with the following figure.

          In many circumstances, we need to compute the splitting of acceleration for only one parameter value. For this example, we will look at how much cleaner the computations above will be if we want to look only at <m>t=1</m>. The first steps for calculating <m>\vv</m> and <m>\va</m> will be the same as before.

          </md>
          You may want to go back and note that this was the only calculus done in the example above; all other steps were vector calculations and properties of orthogonal or unit vectors. We will follow the same method as above, but instead of applying these ideas for all <m>t</m>-values, we will look only at <m>t=1</m>. Remember if the formula we are using works for all <m>t</m>, then the formula will work for a specific <m>t</m>.

          <me>\vT(1) = \frac{\vv}{\Vert\vv\Vert}  = \frac{\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle}{\sqrt{14}} </me>
          This will allow us to calculate <m>a_{\vT}(1)</m> next from the definition <m>a_{\vT}(1) = \va(1) \cdot \vT(1)</m>

          We now use <m>a_{\vN}(1) = \sqrt{\Vert \va(1) \Vert^2  -(a_{\vT}(1))^2}</m> to efficiently calculate the normal component of the acceleration.

          </md>
          We can now compute how much acceleration there is due to turning and use that explicitly compute <m>\vN(1)</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow> a_{\vN}(1) \vN(1) \amp= \va(1) - a_{\vT}(1) \vT(1) </mrow>

          </md>
          You can show that the length of <m>\langle -\frac{11}{7},-\frac{16}{7},\frac{9}{7}\rangle</m> is the same as our calculation for <m>a_{\vN}</m> above. In particular, this means that 
          <me> \vN = \frac{\va - a_{\vT} \vT}{a_{\vN}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{38}} \left\langle -\frac{11}{7},-\frac{16}{7},\frac{9}{7} \right\rangle</me>
          With some diligent computations, you should be able to verify that this result is the same as applying <m>t=1</m> to our expression for <m>\vN</m> from the first task.

    The previous statement may seem a bit like we said the same thing twice, but <m>a_{\vN}</m> and <m>\kappa</m> are not the same. 
    <xref ref="thm-calc-curvature"/> shows that 
    <me>\kappa  = \frac{\left\Vert \frac{d\vT}{dt} \right\Vert}{ \left\Vert \vr'(t) \right\Vert}</me>
    We can solve for <m>\left\Vert \frac{d\vT}{dt} \right\Vert</m> in terms of <m>\kappa</m> to get <m>\left\Vert \frac{d\vT}{dt} \right\Vert= \kappa (speed)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We saw earlier in this section that 
    <me>a_{\vN}= (speed) \Vert\frac{d\vT}{dt}\Vert</me>
    Thus, we can write <m>a_{\vN}</m> in terms of speed and curvature as 
    <men xml:id="kaN"> a_{\vN}=\kappa (\text{speed})^2 </men>
    Equation <xref ref="kaN" /> should help to demonstrate the difference between <m>a_{\vN}</m> and <m>\kappa</m>. Specifically, <m>\kappa</m> measures how fast the path is curving and <m>a_{\vN}</m>, the normal component of acceleration, measures the acceleration felt due to turning. Equation <xref ref="kaN" /> shows that if you and I are moving along the same path but you are going twice as fast as I am, then you will feel <em>four times</em> as much acceleration due to turning (even though we are going along the exact same path). Curvature is how fast the path is turning and <m>a_{\vN}</m> is how fast you feel like you are turning (based on your speed/the parameterization).

  <title>The Driver or the Road?</title>
  <activity>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this activity, we will look at the measurements related to the splitting of acceleration and determine if these measurements are properties of the driver or properties of the road. This is a continuation of <xref ref="driver_road_act" />. As a reminder, a measurement is a property of the driver if the value of that measurement <alert>can</alert> be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers <alert>must</alert> have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). The explanations for the next tasks may be difficult for you to write but will be very helpful in ensuring you understand the vector calculus concepts of this chapter.

    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Pedal Usage: We measure the pedal usage as either +, -, or zero in the following way:
          <ul>
            <li>+ if the gas pedal is being used</li>
            <li>- if the brake pedal is being used</li>
            <li>zero if no pedal is being used</li>
          </ul>
          Since our race car drivers are safety minded, they do not use more than one pedal at a time. Note that this measurement will just be a sign and not a numerical value. The pedal usage will give us the sign of which vector calculus quantity? Be sure to explain your answer.

        <p>
          The acceleration vector for a parameterization of a curve, <m>C</m>, can be split into parts in the direction of travel and direction of turning
          <me>
            \va=a_{\vT}\vT+a_{\vN}\vN
          </me>
          where <m>a_{\vT}=\va \cdot \vT</m> and <m>a_{\vN}=\va \cdot \vN</m>. 
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The scalar <m>a_{\vT}</m> measures the rate of change of the speed. The scalar <m>a_{\vN}</m> measure the acceleration due to change in direction and can be calculated by 
          <me>a_{\vN}=\kappa (speed)^2</me>
          where <m>\kappa</m> is the curvature.
