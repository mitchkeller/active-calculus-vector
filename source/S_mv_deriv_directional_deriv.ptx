      This section relies on many of the tools we have developed throughout <xref ref="C_MVF"/>, most importantly we will use the linearization from <xref ref="S-mv_deriv-linearization"/>. The chain rule introduced in <xref ref="S_mv_deriv-chain_rule"/> is used to define an efficient calculation of the directional derivative but is not critical for this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will likely want to cover this section over several classes since these ideas are important to many other partner fields. The gradient is defined after the development of the directional derivative because the interpretations of the gradient are dependent on the directional derivative.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      The partial derivatives of a multivariable function tell us the instantaneous rate at which the function's output changes as we hold all but one input variable constant (allowing the remaining input variable to change). It is natural to wonder how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in a direction other than parallel to a coordinate axes. In this section, we investigate this question and will connect the rates of change in other directions to the rates of change given by the partial derivatives. The Preview Activity investigates these concepts in terms of a contour map representing elevation in terms of location.

      We can use cardinal directions to specify the direction of displacement vectors. These directions can be described by a compass rose. The compass rose given in <xref ref="comp_rose1" /> is an example of a sixteen point compass rose. Directions of the form ESE are read as <q>east-southeast</q> and point in the direction halfway between east and southeast.

      The Preview Activity demonstrates how visual information such as a contour plot or a surface plot can be helpful in determining information about how quickly the output of a function changes as its inputs change in different directions. In this section, we will focus on how to calculate this kind of directional derivative using algebraic or numerical representations of functions and relate this calculation to other ways we have described change for a function. 
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Directional Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      We begin by determining how to measure the rate of change for a function of two variables in a direction that is not parallel to one of the coordinate directions. We use the classic calculus approach to set up this measurement: approximate the measurement, quantify how the approximation changes on a smaller scale, and finally use a limit to find the value. To measure the rate of change in the output of a function, we use a difference quotient:
      <me>
        \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change in output}}{\text{change in input}}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>f</m> be a function of the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. We wish to measure the rate of change of <m>f</m> at the base point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\langle a,b\rangle</m>. To do this, we write the difference quotient using the points <m>(x_0+a,y_0+b)</m> and <m>(x_0,y_0</m>):
      <me>\frac{f(x_0+a,y_0+b)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</me>.
      The denominator comes from using the distance formula to measure the change in the input as distance in the <m>xy</m>-plane. <xref ref="CCA-DD1" /> shows the plot of a surface given by <m>z=f(x,y)</m> with the points used in the difference quotient labeled.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The difference quotient above is the first step in the classic calculus approach and provides a good start to approximating the rate of change for the output of <m>f</m> in the direction <m>\langle a,b\rangle</m>. However, it is not clear how this approximation changes when we look at smaller scales. Specifically, we need to look at what happens to this approximation as we shrink the step size <m>\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m> to <m>0</m> while maintaining the same direction of change. In order to maintain our direction <em>and</em> look at smaller step sizes, we must separate the length of the vector <m>\langle a,b \rangle </m> from its direction. To do this, we use the unit vector in the direction of <m>\langle a,b \rangle</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vu=\langle u_1,u_2\rangle </m> be the unit vector in the same direction as <m>\langle a,b \rangle</m>. Vectors in the same direction as <m>\langle a,b \rangle</m> can be written in the form <m> t \langle u_1,u_2\rangle</m>, where <m>t</m> is the step size and <m>\vu=\langle u_1,u_2\rangle </m> is the unit vector. Taking a step of length <m>t</m> in the direction <m>\langle u_1,u_2 \rangle</m>, the difference quotient can be written as
      <me>\frac{f(x_0+t (u_1),y_0+t(u_2))-f(x_0,y_0)}{t}</me>.
      We will look at how this difference quotient changes at smaller scales, i.e., when the step size <m>t</m> gets smaller. This accomplishes the second step of the classic calculus approach because it quantifyies how the approximation works on smaller scales. We can now take the limit as <m>t \to 0</m> to define the directional derivative.

When we evaluate the directional derivative <m>D_{\vu} f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>, the result <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate at which <m>f</m> changes at <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> per unit increase in the direction of the vector <m>\vu</m>.

    <p>
      We can connect <xref ref="E_DirDerDef">equation</xref> to our work on traces earlier in this chapter. When initially exploring surface plots, we simplified our approach by looking at slices that were parallel to one of the coordinate axes, obtained by holding the other input variable constant. This allowed us to use ideas from single-variable calculus to understand more about the surface and to motivate the definitions of partial derivatives. Similarly, we can cut the surface in the <m>\langle u_1,u_2\rangle </m> direction through the base point and then think about the directional derivative as a single-variable calculus problem. In particular, we can parameterize the trace along the surface by noticing our inputs correspond to the line in the xy-plane given by <m>\langle x_0+ u_1 t, y_0 + u_2 t\rangle</m>, which is shown in red on <xref ref="CCA-DD2"/>.

    <title>Efficiently Computing the Directional Derivative</title>
    <p>
      We want to find a way to evaluate directional derivatives without resorting to evaluating the limit definition in <xref ref="E_DirDerDef">equation</xref> every time. We will look at this algebraic approach from two perspectives. First, we will use the chain rule from <xref ref="S_mv_deriv-chain_rule"/> to define a simple algebraic rule which will allow us to efficiently calculate directional derivatives. Second, we will use the linearization of a locally linear function to compute directional derivatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are interested in the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in the direction of a unit vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m>. In particular, the input variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are changing according to
      <me>
        x = x_0 + u_1t \quad \text{ and }  \quad y = y_0 + u_2t
      </me>.
      A trace along the surface in the direction of <m>\langle u_1,u_2\rangle</m> is given by <m>\vr(t)=\langle x_0+ u_1 t, y_0 + u_2 t , f(x_0+ u_1 t, y_0 + u_2 t) \rangle</m>. Observe that <m>\frac{dx}{dt} = u_1</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = u_2</m> for all values of <m>t</m>. Since <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector in the <m>xy</m>-plane, a unit change in the parameter <m>t</m> corresponds to moving one unit in the <m>\vu</m> direction. This allows us to use the multivariable chain rule to calculate the directional derivative as a measure of the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> in the direction <m>\vu</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output of <m>f</m> along the given direction can be written as a composition of functions, <m>f(t)=f(\vr(t))=f(x(t), y(t))</m>, which means we can apply the multivariable chain rule:
      <md>
        <mrow>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left[ f(\vr(t)) \right] </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = f_x(x_0,y_0)\frac{dx}{dt} + f_y(x_0,y_0)\frac{dy}{dt} </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = f_x(x_0,y_0) u_1 + f_y(x_0,y_0) u_2 </mrow>
      </md>
      This allows us to compute the directional derivative at an arbitrary point according to the following formula.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="Directional-derivative">
      <title>Calculating Directional Derivatives</title>
      <p>
        Given a differentiable function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> and a unit vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m>, the directional derivative <m>D_{\vu}f(x,y)</m> can be computed by
        <men xml:id="eq_10_6_DD">
          D_{\vu}f(x,y) = f_x(x,y) u_1 + f_y(x,y) u_2
        </men>.
      </p>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      To use <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD">equation</xref>, we must have a <em>unit</em> vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> in the direction of motion. In the event that we have a direction prescribed by a non-unit vector, we must first scale the vector to have length 1. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        We will look at an example that is algebraically and geometrically simple but allows us to use <xref ref="Directional-derivative"/>. We will consider the rate of change for the function <m>f(x,y)=2.5-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2}-\frac{(y+1)^2}{9}</m> at the input point <m>(2,2)</m> in several directions.

        We will compute the directional derivative of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(2,2)</m> in the direction of <m>\langle-2,-1\rangle</m>. Since <m>\langle-2,1\rangle</m> is not a unit vector, we use <m>\vu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\langle -2,1\rangle</m> as the unit vector in this direction. To use <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD">equation</xref>, we will need the partial derivatives of <m>f</m>:
        <me> f_x= -\frac{2(x-1)}{2} \quad \text{ and } \quad f_y=-\frac{2(y+1)}{9} </me>
        At <m>(2,2)</m>, we have <m>f_x(2,2)=-1</m> and <m>f_y(2,2)=-\frac{2}{3}</m>. By <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD">equation</xref>, the directional derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>(2,2)</m> in the direction <m>\vu</m> is
        <me>Df_\vu (2,2)=f_x(2,2) u_1 + f_y(2,2) u_2 = (-1)(-3)+\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)(1)=\frac{7}{3} </me>.
        We can interpret this as saying that for a small step in the direction of <m>\vu</m> at <m>(2,2)</m>, we would expect the output of <m>f</m> to increase by <m>\frac{7}{3}</m> times the step size.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may be a bit difficult to see based on the contour plot in <xref ref="DDexample1"/>. However, the surface plot combined with a plot of the path of inputs in the direction <m>\vu</m> gives a better visualization. <xref ref="DDexample2"/> shows a surface plot of <m>z=f(x,y)</m> with the trace in the <m>\vu</m>-direction shown in blue and the direction vector <m>\vu</m> shown in red on the <m>xy</m>-plane. The black line segment shows how <m>Df_\vu(2,2)</m> is positive because the <m>z</m>-coordinate of this tangent line increases as we move away from <m>(2,2)</m> in the <m>\vu</m>-direction.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="DDexample2">

      <p>  
        Remember that the directional derivative is a local measurement and only applies in a small neighborhood of a point and only in the direction <m>\vu</m>. In other words, <m>Df_\vu(2,2)</m> does not describe the the rate of change at other points along the blue curve, only the rate of change along the blue curve for a small step away from our base point in the red direction. With plots like <xref ref="DDexample1"/>, you may be tempted to use information far away from the point of interest to try to figure out the rate of change. However, like most calculus measurements, we must only use plots to provide information on what is happening near a specific point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If we compute <m>Df_\vj(2,2)</m>, the rate of change for the output of <m>f</m> in the direction <m>\vj=\langle 0,1\rangle</m> at <m>(2,2)</m>, using <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD">equation</xref>, then we have
        <me>Df_\vj (2,2)=f_x(2,2) u_1+f_y(2,2) u_2=(-1)(0)+(-\frac{2}{3})(1)=-\frac{2}{3} </me>.
        This corresponds to the partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref="DDexample3"/> allows you to adjust the direction of the trace shown. By default, it shows the direction vector <m>\vj</m>, the cooresponding trace, and tangent line to the surface in the <m>\vj</m> direction. Use the slider at the top of <xref ref="DDexample3"/> to change the direction in which you want to evaluate the directional derivative. As you do so, examine how the steepness of the black tangent segment varies depending on the direction.

      <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD">Equation</xref> arose through consideration of the <xref ref="defn-DD" text="custom">definition for the directional derivative</xref> as a composition of functions and application of the chain rule. When considering multivariable functions that are locally linear, reclal that we have discussed that we can evaluate the limit of such a function near a point by analyzing the linearization or tangent plane. Remember that on very small scales there is virtually no difference between the (locally linear) function and the linearization as demonstrated by <xref ref="fig-mv_deriv-linearization-tangent_4"/>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The equation of the plane tangent to the graph of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))</m> is

        z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)

      If <m>f</m> is a locally linear function, then the directional derivative <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0)</m> will be the same as the rate of change along the tangent plane in the direction of <m>\vu</m>. Remember that the rate of change will be the same regardless of step size on the tangent plane (this is NOT true on the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m>). So we will look at the quotient
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{z(x_0+u_1,y_0+u_2)-z(x_0,y_0)}{\sqrt{u_1^2+u_2^2}}</mrow>

      which is exactly the result <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD"/>. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="gradient_ss">
    <title>The Gradient</title>
    <p>
      Via the chain rule and linearization, we have seen that for a given function, <m>f = f(x,y)</m>, its instantaneous rate of change in the direction of a unit vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> is given by
      <men xml:id="E_DDrevisited">
        D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)u_1 + f_y(x_0,y_0)u_2
      </men>
      In particular, we saw how the rate of change along the linearization in a given direction is given by a linear combination of the rates of change in the coordinate directions (partial derivatives) where the weight of each partial derivative comes from the components of our unit vector. You may recognize the form of <xref ref="E_DDrevisited"/> as being similar to a dot product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall the dot product of two vectors <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle</m> and <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> is computed by
      <me>
        \vv \cdot \vu = v_1 u_1 + v_2 u_2
      </me>
      Thus we can think about Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_DDrevisited"/> in a way that will have geometric meaning related to the dot product. In particular, we see that <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0)</m> is the dot product of the vector <m>\left\langle f_x(x_0,y_0), f_y(x_0,y_0) \right\rangle</m> and the vector <m>\vu=\langle u_1,u_2\rangle</m>. This is particularly useful because the vector <m>\left\langle f_x(x_0,y_0), f_y(x_0,y_0) \right\rangle</m> comes from simple calculations that tell us how the function <m>f</m> is changing near the input <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. We give this vector a special name and will spend most of the rest of this section talking about the importance of this vector.

    <p>
      As a vector, <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> defines a direction and a length. As we will see in the next subsection, both of these convey important information about the behavior of <m>f</m> near
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="vec-grad">
    <title>Vector Properties of the Gradient</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Directional-derivative-gradient"/> shows how we can separate the directional derivative of a function of two variables into two separate parts: 1) the gradient vector evaluated at the point of interest and 2) the unit vector in the direction we want to change the inputs of the function. This separation will be vital to explaining the  the vector properties of the gradient (direction and magnitude). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall from <xref ref="E_9_3_dot_angle">Equation</xref> that the dot product of two vectors depends on the lengths of the vectors and the angle between the vectors. So if <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>\vu</m> (where <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector), then by <xref ref="eq_10_6_DD_grad"/> and <xref ref="E_9_3_dot_angle"/>, respectively,
      <md>
        <mrow>  D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) \amp= \nabla f(x_0,y_0)\cdot\vu </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= \vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)} \vecmag{\vu} \cos(\theta) </mrow>
      </md>
      Remember that our vector <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector (<m>\vecmag{\vu}=1</m>), so the value of the directional derivative will be the length of the gradient vector times the cosine of the angle between <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>\vu</m>. 
      <men xml:id="DD-vecprop">D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) =\vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)} \cos(\theta)</men>
      <xref ref="DD-vecprop">Equation</xref> will be <em>extremely</em> useful in understanding all of the elements that gradient describes.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="F_10_6_gradient_sign">
      <caption>The sign of <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> is determined by <m>\theta</m> </caption>

      <image source="images/fig_10_6_gradient_angle_1"/>
      <image source="images/fig_10_6_gradient_angle_2"/>
      <image source="images/fig_10_6_gradient_angle_3"/>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Because the magnitude of a vector is always non-negative, whether a directional derivative will be positive/negative/zero will depend on <m>\cos(\theta)</m>. <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign"/> graphically shows examples of the following statements (from left to right):
      <ul>
        <li>If the angle between the gradient and our direction vector is a right angle, then the directional derivative will be zero. </li>
        <li>If the angle between the gradient and our direction vector is acute, then the directional derivative will be positive. </li>
        <li>If the angle between the gradient and our direction vector is obtuse, then the directional derivative will be neagtive. </li>
      </ul>
      In particular, the second statement shows why the gradient will be perpendicular to the level curve through the point of interest. The level curve is the set of points that have a particular value for the output of our function, so the directional derivative in a direction tangent to the level curve must be zero. Remember that the level curve corresponds to input points with the same output value, therefore the output will not change along the level curve and the directional derivative along the level curve must be zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can expand our explanation to the other statements as well. The output of <m>f</m> will be increasing in any direction that makes an acute angle with the gradient vector and the output of <m>f</m> will be decreasing in any direction that makes an obtuse angle with the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
      So by looking at different directions, the directional derivative at our input point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> will vary with positive, negative, and zero values. It is natural to ask the following questions about how the directional derivative changes at a point:
      <ul>
        <li>What direction corresponds to the <em>largest</em> value for the directional derivative?</li>
        <li>What is the largest value possible for the directional derivative at a particular input <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>?</li>
        <li>What direction corresponds to the <em>smallest</em> (or most negative) value for the directional derivative?</li>
        <li>What is the smallest value possible for the directional derivative at a particular input <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>?</li>
      </ul>
      All of these questions can be answered with <xref ref="DD-vecprop">Equation</xref>. Because the length of the gradient vector does not change when we look in different directions, the <m>\cos(\theta)</m> term will tell us when we have the maximum and minimum values. We only need to consider values of <m>\theta</m> between 0 and <m>\pi</m> inclusive because <m>\theta</m> is the (smallest) angle between two vectors. Therefore, we will have the largest value of the directional derivative when <m>\cos(\theta)</m> has its maximum output of 1 at <m>\theta=0</m>. So when the direction vector <m>\vu</m> is in the exact same direction as the gradient, we have the maximum value of the directional derivative <em>AND</em> the largest value of the directional derivative is the length of the gradient; If <m>\vu</m> is in the same direction as <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = \vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)} \cos(0) =\vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a parallel argument, the minimum (most negative) value the directional derivative can take is when <m>\theta=\pi</m>, the direction vector is in the opposite direction of the gradient vector. Thus if <m>\theta=\pi</m>, then <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = \vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)} \cos(\pi) = -\vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)}</m> because <m>\cos(\pi)=-1</m>.
    </p>  


    <!-- <p>
      In particular, when <m>\theta</m> is a right angle, as shown on the left of
      <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign">Figure</xref>, then <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = 0</m>, because <m>\cos(\theta) = 0</m>. Since the value of the directional derivative is 0, this means that <m>f</m> is unchanging in this direction, and hence <m>\vu</m> must be tangent to the contour of <m>f</m> that passes through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In other words, <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> is orthogonal to the
      contour through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. This shows that the gradient vector at a given point is always perpendicular to the contour passing through the point, confirming that what we saw in part (c) of <xref ref="A_10_6_10">Activity</xref> holds in general.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      Moreover, when <m>\theta</m> is an acute angle, it follows that <m>\cos(\theta) &gt; 0</m> so since
      <me>
        D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)||\vu|
        \cos(\theta),
      </me>
      and therefore <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) &gt; 0</m>, as shown in the middle image in <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign">Figure</xref>. This means that <m>f</m> is increasing in any direction where
      <m>\theta</m> is acute. In a similar way, when <m>\theta</m> is an obtuse angle, then <m>\cos(\theta) \lt  0</m> so <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) \lt  0</m>, as seen on the right in <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign">Figure</xref>. This
      means that <m>f</m> is decreasing in any direction for which <m>\theta</m> is obtuse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, as we can see in the following activity, we may also use the gradient to determine the directions in which the function is increasing and decreasing most rapidly.

    <title>The Length of the Gradient</title>
    <p>
      Having established in <xref ref="A_10_6_3">Activity</xref> that the direction in which a function increases most rapidly at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is the unit vector <m>\vu</m> in the direction of the gradient, (that is, <m>\vu = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} \nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m>, provided that <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0) \ne \vzero</m>), it is also natural to ask, <q>in the direction of greatest increase for <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, what is the <em>value</em> of the rate of increase?</q> In this situation, we are asking for the value of <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> where <m>\vu = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} \nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the now familiar way to compute the directional derivative, we see that
      <me>
        D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) = \nabla f(x_0,y_0) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} \nabla f(x_0,y_0) \right).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we recall two important facts about the dot product: (i) <m>\vw\cdot (c \vv) = c (\vw \cdot \vv)</m> for any scalar <m>c</m>, and (ii) <m>\vw \cdot \vw = |\vw|^2</m>. Applying these properties to the most recent equation involving the directional derivative, we find that
      <me>
        D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|}  (\nabla f(x_0,y_0) \cdot \nabla f(x_0,y_0)) = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|^2.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, since <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> is a nonzero vector, its length <m>|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|</m> is a nonzero scalar, and thus we can simplify the preceding equation to establish that
      <me>
        D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) = |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|.
      </me>
    </p>-->
    <p>
      We summarize our most recent work by stating important facts about the gradient.

That is, if <m>\vu = -\frac{1}{\vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)}} \nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector in the direction of greatest decrease of <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, and <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) =  -\vecmag{\nabla f(x_0,y_0)}</m>. </li>

      In <xref ref="DD-sensemaking1" />, we will look at how the directional derivative will change as a function of the direction used or of the point where the directional derivative is being evaluated. The goals of these tasks are to understand the directional derivative as a geometric measurement using visually-based sense making prompts in terms of the location and directions being used. These activities are adapted from materials developed by Rafael Martinez-Planell.

      The gradient has many natural applications. For example, situations often arise <mdash/> for instance, constructing a road through the mountains or planning the flow of water across a landscape <mdash/> where we are interested in knowing the direction in which a function is increasing or decreasing most rapidly. In the next activity, we will look at how the gradient can help you navigate to the top of a mountain in foggy conditions.
    </p>
    <worksheet>
  <activity workspace="1.5in" xml:id="foggymtn1">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this activity, we will make sense of the directional derivatives and gradients in terms of a function that measures the elevation. We are hiking in a foggy park and cannot see anything more than a few feet in front of us. There is nothing blocking us from walking in any particular direction but because of the fog we cannot see where the highest point on the mountain is. We want to try to find the top of the mountain, but we don't have a map or trail or any line of sight to other landmarks. Our compass still works in the fog, so we can tell what direction North/South/East/West are.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to use some of our calculations tools from multivariable calculus, we will think of the elevation at different locations in the park given by a function <m>h(x,y)</m> where <m>x</m> is your location in the East (positive <m>x</m>)/West (negative <m>x</m>) direction and <m>y</m> is your location in the North (positive <m>y</m>)/South (negative <m>y</m>) direction.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>P_1</m> be your current location in the foggy park. You use your compass to find the East and North directions. At <m>P_1</m>, you find that the ground rises 1 meter per 50 meters traveled in the East direction and the ground rises 2.5 meters per 50 meters traveled in the North direction. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Use this information to give <m>\nabla h (P_1)</m>.

            Use your answer to the previous task to say what direction is <q>uphill</q> at <m>P_1</m> and state how steep the mountain is in this direction. 
          </p>

      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            You decide to walk uphill from your location <m>P_1</m> in order to try to find the top of the mountain. After walking in the same direction for a while, you notice that you are no longer walking in the steepest direction. So at your new location, which we will call <m>P_2</m>, you find the East and North directions and measure the steepness of the mountain in these directions. You find that the ground rises 1.5 meters per 75 meters traveled in the East direction and the ground goes down 0.5 meters per 100 meters traveled in the North direction. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Use this new information to calculate <m>\nabla h (P_2)</m>, find the uphill direction, and give state how steep the mountain is in the uphill direction at <m>P_2</m>.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If we use this method of walking in the uphill direction for a ways and then finding the new uphill direction, do you think we will have to find the top of the mountain? You should write a few sentences to justify your ideas and be sure to state how you will know you are at the top of the mountain. Remember that you can't see very far in front of you.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The directional derivative of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(x,y)</m> in the direction of the unit vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> is
          <me>
            D_{\vu}f(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+u_1h, y+u_2h) - f(x,y)}{h}
          </me>
          for those values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> for which the limit exists.  In addition, <m>D_{\vu}f(x,y)</m> measures the slope of the graph of <m>f</m> when we move in the direction <m>\vu</m>. Alternatively, <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> in the direction <m>\vu</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The gradient of a function <m>f=f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is the vector
          <me>
            \nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \left\langle f_x(x_0,y_0), f_y(x_0,y_0)\right\rangle
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The directional derivative in the direction <m>\vu</m> may be computed by
          <me>
            D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = \nabla f(x_0,y_0)\cdot \vu
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          At any point where the gradient is nonzero, the gradient is orthogonal to the contour through that point and points in the direction in which <m>f</m> increases most
          rapidly; moreover, the slope of <m>f</m> in this direction equals the length of the gradient <m>|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|</m>.  Similarly, the direction opposite of the gradient is the direction of greatest decrease, and that rate of decrease is the negative length of the gradient.
