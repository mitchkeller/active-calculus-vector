        The Ideal Gas Law, <m>PV = RT</m>, relates the pressure (<m>P</m>, in pascals), temperature (<m>T</m>, in Kelvin), and volume (<m>V</m>, in cubic meters) of 1 mole of a gas (<m>R =  8.314 \ \frac{\text{J} }{\text{ mol }  \ \text{K} }</m> is the universal gas constant), and describes the behavior of gases that do not liquefy easily, such as oxygen and hydrogen. We can solve the ideal gas law for the volume and hence treat the volume as a function of the pressure and temperature:

  <statement>
    <p>
      When people buy a large ticket item like a
      car or a house, they often take out a loan to make the purchase. The
      loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of
      the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the
      borrower has to make depends on the amount <m>P</m> of money borrowed
      (called the principal), the duration <m>t</m> of the loan in years, and
      the interest rate <m>r</m>. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment <m>M</m> that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula
      <me>
        M(r,t) = \frac{1500r}{1-\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}}.

              We cannot have a negative value under the square root. Therefore <m>4 - \left( x^{2} + y^{2} \right) \geq 0</m>, so <m>x^{2} + y^{2} \leq 4</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The maximum value of the square root is equal to 2 when <m>x=0, y=0</m>. The minimum value of the square root is 0. Subtract these values from 8 to a range of <m>6 \leq h(x,y) \leq 8</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Subtract 8 from both sides to get <m>h - 8 = - \sqrt{4 - x^2 - y^2}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Divide by -1 to get <m>8 - h = \sqrt{4 - x^2 - y^2}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Square both side to get <m>(8-h)^2 = 4 -x^2 -y^2</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Then <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4 - (8-h)^2</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the formula for a circle centered at <m>(0,0)</m> with a radius of <m>\sqrt{4 - (8-h)^2}</m>.

              It follow from part d that if <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4 - (8-h)^2</m>, then <m>x^2 = 4 - (8-h)^2 - y^2</m> and <m>x = - \sqrt{4 - (8-h)^2 - x^2}</m>. Then choose y values to graph the traces.
