                  f(1.1, 2.05) = 2(1.1)^2 + 3(2.05)^3 = 28.265375

                  Just as we can find a local linearization for a differentiable function of two variables, we can do so for functions of three or more variables.  By extending the concept of the local linearization from two to three variables, find the linearization of the function <m>h(x,y,z) =
                    e^{2x}(y+z^2)</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0) = (0, 1, -2)</m>.  Then, use the

                So the linearization of <m>f</m> at <m>(0,0)</m> is

                  L(x,y) = f(0,0) + f_x(0,0)(x-0)+f_y(0,0)(y-0) = 3+2y

                Since <m>I(94,75) = 122</m>, the linearization of <m>I</m> at <m>(94,75)</m> is

                  Resistors used in electrical circuits have colored bands painted

            In this section we argued that if <m>f = f(x,y)</m> is a function of two variables and if <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> both exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. This condition ensures that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, but it does not define what it means for <m>f</m> to be differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this exercise we explore the definition of differentiability of a function of two variables in more detail. Throughout, let <m>g</m> be the function defined by <m>g(x,y)=  \sqrt{|xy|}</m>.

                  Recall that if a function <m>f = f(x)</m> of a single variable is differentiable at <m>x=x_0</m>, then 
                  <me>f'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}</me>
                  exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of <m>f'(x_0)</m> means that the graph of <m>f</m> is locally linear at <m>x=x_0</m>. In other words, the graph of <m>f</m> looks like its linearization <m>L(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>x_0</m>. That is, the values of <m>f(x)</m> can be closely approximated by <m>L(x)</m> as long as <m>x</m> is close to <m>x_0</m>. We can measure how good the approximation of <m>L(x)</m> is to <m>f(x)</m> with the error function 
                  <me>E(x) = L(x) - f(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0) - f(x).</me>
                  As <m>x</m> approaches <m>x_0</m>, <m>E(x)</m> approaches <m>f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(0) - f(x_0) = 0</m>, and so <m>L(x)</m> provides increasingly better approximations to <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer to <m>x_0</m>. 

                  Show that, even though <m>g(x,y) = \sqrt{|xy|}</m> is not locally linear at <m>(0,0)</m>, its error term
                  <me>E(x,y) = L(x,y) - g(x,y)</me>
                  at <m>(0,0)</m> has a limit of <m>0</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m>. (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to <m>0</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to <m>0</m> does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider <m>f = f(x)</m> as a function of one variable. If we let <m>x = x_0+h</m>, where <m>|h|</m> is the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>x_0</m>, then the relative error in approximating <m>f(x_0+h)</m> with <m>L(x_0+h)</m> is  
                  <me>\frac{E(x_0+h)}{h}.</me>
                  Show that, for a function <m>f = f(x)</m> of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is <m>0</m> as <m>h</m> approaches <m>0</m>.  

                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of <m>0</m> at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then if <m>x = x_0+h</m> and <m>y = y_0+k</m>, the distance from <m>(x,y)</m> to <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{h^2+k^2}</m>.

                  A function <m>f</m> is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function <m>L</m> in the definition is the linearization of <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.

Conclude that the existence of partial derivatives at a point is not enough to ensure differentiability at that point. (Hint: Consider the limit along different paths.)

          <p>
            Consider the relative error. Along the path <m>h = 0</m> we have  
            <md>
              <mrow> \frac{E(x_0 + h, y_0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} \amp = \frac{E(x_0, y_0 + k)}{\sqrt{k^2}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - L(x_0, y_0 + k)}{\sqrt{k^2}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - \left ( f(x_0, y_0) + m(x_0 - x_0) + n(y_0 + k - y_0) \right )}{\sqrt{k^2}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{\left ( f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) \right ) - n(k)}{\vert k \vert }  </mrow>
            </md>.  
            Recall that 
            <me>
              f_y(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{ f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k}
            </me>.
            Since the limit of the relative error is <m>0</m> we must have  
            <md>
              <mrow> 0 \amp = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{E(x_0 + h, y_0 + k)}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{\left ( f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) \right ) - n(k)}{\vert k \vert } </mrow>
            </md>.
            From here we can show that 
            <md>
              <mrow> 0 \amp = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{\left ( f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) \right ) - n(k)}{k} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k \to 0} \left ( \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) }{k} - n \right )</mrow>
            </md>
            which implies  
            <me>
              n = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0) }{k} = f_y(x_0, y_0) 
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similiarly, by taking the limit along the path <m>k=0</m> we can show that 
            <me>
              m = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0) }{k} = f_x(x_0, y_0) 
            </me>.

      <exercise xml:id="Ez_10_4_6">
        <statement>
          <p>
            We know that if a function of a single variable is differentiable at a point, then that function is also continuous at that point. In this exercise we determine that the same property holds for functions of two variables. 

            A function <m>f</m> of the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is continuous at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in its domain if 
            <me>\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0)</me>
            or (letting <m>x=x_0+h</m> and <m>y = y_0 + k</m>, 
            <me>\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} f(x_0+h,y+k) = f(x_0,y_0).</me>

            Show that if <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. (Hint: Multiply both sides of the equality that comes from differentiability by <m>\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \sqrt{h^2+k^2}</m>.)

            We know <m>\lim_{(h, k) \to (0,0)} (mh + nk) = 0</m>, so we have
