                As a rational function,

                Since <m>x^4 + y^2 = 0</m> only when <m>x=y=0</m>,
                the domain of <m>g</m> is all ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> not equal to <m>(0,0)</m>,

              <p>
                Along the non-vertical path <m>y=mx</m> we have
                <me>
                  f(x,mx) = \frac{2x^2(mx) }{x^4 + (mx)^2} = \frac{2mx^3}{x^4 + m^2 x^2} = \frac{2mx^3}{x^2 (1 + m^2)} = \frac{2mx}{1 + m^2}

                so
                <me>
                  \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(x,mx) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{2mx}{1 + m^2} = 0
                </me>.
                Additionally, along the vertical line <m>x=0</m> we have 
                <me>
                  \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(0,y) = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{0}{y^2} =  0
                </me>.  
                So <m>\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} h(x,y) = 0</m> along all linear paths that contain the origin.

                No, <m>\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} h(x,y)</m> does not exist. From our work above it seems that <m>\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} h(x,y)</m> may be 0. However, consider the limit along the path <m>y=x^2</m>. We have 
                <me>
                  \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(x,x^2) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{2x^2(x^2) }{x^4 + (x^2)^2} = \frac{2x^4}{x^4 + x^4} = \frac{2x^4}{2x^4} = 1
                </me>. 
                Since the limits along different paths are not equal, the limit does not exist. On a surface plot of <m>h(x, y)</m> we can see that along the <m>x</m>-axis and the <m>y</m>-axis (excluding the origin) the value of <m>h</m> is 0, while along the curve <m>y=x^2</m> (excluding the origin) the value of <m>h</m> is 1. On CalcPlot3D the top of the graph looks somewhat jagged rather than smooth. On the contour plots, contours associated with different function values all approach the origin, indicating that near the origin the function takes on different values. This also provides evidence that the limit does not exist. (GRAPHS NEEDED HERE?)

                The first limit is the same as
                <m> \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} s(x,y) = 3</m> along the path <m>y=x</m> and the second is
                <m> \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} s(x,y) = 6</m> along the path <m>y=2x</m>.
                So <m>s</m> has different limits at <m>(0,0)</m> along different paths.
                Therefore, there is no such function for which <m> \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} s(x,y)</m> exists.

                In this section we showed that the function <m>f</m> defined by

                  f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2}

                is not defined at <m>(0,0)</m> but has a limit at <m>(0,0)</m>.
                We can translate this function to
                <me>
                  t(x,y) = \frac{(x-1)^2(y-1)^2}{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}
                </me>,
                that is not defined at <m>(1,1)</m> but for which <m> \lim_{(x,y) \to (1,1)} t(x,y)</m> does exist
                (and is <m>0</m>).

                  The function <m>f</m> is undefined with <m>x-y=0</m>, so it is not continuous along the line <m>y=x</m>. It is continuous everywhere else since it is the quotient of continuous functions.

                  Here the denominator is never 0, so the function <m>g</m> is continuous everywhere since it is the quotient of two continuous functions.

                  At all points other than <m>(0, 0)</m> the function <m>k</m> is continuous because it is the quotient of continuous functions.

We can prove that <m> \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} k(x,y) = 0</m> by using the Squeeze Theorem, and so <m> \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} k(x,y) = k (0, 0)</m>. Thus <m>k</m> is continuous everywhere.
