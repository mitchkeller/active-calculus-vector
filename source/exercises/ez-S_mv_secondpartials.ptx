                For <m>I_T(96,75)</m> we can only use a backwards difference quotient,

                The fact that <m>I_{TT}(94,75) \approx 0.125</m> means that for every one

                The fact that <m>I_{HH}(94,75) \approx 0.02</m> means that for every one % increase in the relative humidity from 75%, the rate at which the heat index changes as the relative humidity increases grows by approximately 0.02

                In other words,
                <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(4.1,5)</m> should be approximately the same as <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(4,5)</m>
