  <title>How to Use this Text</title>
    <p>
      Because the text is free, any professor or student may use the electronic version of the text for no charge. For reading on laptops or mobile devices, the best electronic version to use is <url href="https://activecalculus.org/multi/"><c>the .html version of the text</c></url>, but you can find links to a pdf and hard copy of the text at <url href="https://activecalculus.org/"><c>https://activecalculus.org/</c></url>. Furthermore, because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the full set of source files, which are <url href="https://github.com/active-calculus/active-calculus-vector"> available on GitHub</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the 25-26 academic year, you can find a preview version of the Second Edition of ACM at <url href="https://nelong.github.io/active-calculus-vector/multi/frontmatter.html"/> and the instructor version at <url href="https://nelong.github.io/active-calculus-vector/multi-instructor/frontmatter.html"/>. We anticipate having a release version of the Second Edition in August 2026 and we will have both pdf and html version of the First Edition available for faculty who want to continue to use that version of ACM. For a complete description of the differences between the first and second editions see <url href="https://activecalculus.org/acm/acm-1e-vs-2e/"/>

      This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivariable calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. <xref ref="C_MVPrecalc">Chapter</xref> covers the precalculus ideas necessary for multivariable calculus: coordinates, vectors and common graphs (planes, lines, quadric surfaces, and cylinder surfaces) in three dimensions. <xref ref="C_VVF"/> covers vector-valued functions of one variable and introduces how to use vector tools and calculus on these functions. <xref ref="C_MVF">Chapter</xref> introduces functions of more than one variable and studies differentiation of functions of several independent variables in detail, addressing the typical topics including limits, partial derivatives, and optimization. <xref ref="C_MI">Chapter</xref> motivates and defines double and triple integrals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="C_Vector"/> covers vector fields and vector calculus topics through Stokes Theorem and the Divergence Theorem. The 2nd edition of ACM has evolved because in reality, “multivariable calculus” can mean one of three different courses: one that follows chapters 9-11 of the 1st edition and omits vector calculus entirely; one that introduces students to line integrals, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, and Green's Theorem; and one that proceeds through all of that material plus Stokes's Theorem and Gauss's Divergence Theorem. As such, the extent to which certain topics in the new chapters 9-12 are necessary varies depending on the course's final destination.

        <title>Electronic Edition</title>
          <p>
            Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them.
            Also, the electronic versions of the text includes links to on-line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer.

            Beginning with the Second Edition, we have written activities and the presentation of material with the html as the primary focus. For example, almost every 3D plot will be interactable in the html version of the text (can rotate, zoom, or use interactive tools like sliders and buttons) which offers students the option to literally look at the objects from a different perspective. 
            
          </p>

           <p>
            <em>Note:</em> In the pdf version, there is sometimes not an obvious visual indicator of the html links, so some available information is suppressed and there are often links or QR codes to view an interactable plot. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the html version.

          <title>Activities Workbook</title>
            <p>
              Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development.
