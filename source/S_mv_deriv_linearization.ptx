      This section relies on the ideas of planes from <xref ref="S-Precalc-Lines"/> and first partial derivatives as measuring the tilt of a surface plot at a particular location from <xref ref="S-10-2-First-Order-Partial-Derivatives"/>. Some instructors will only cover a subset of the linearization tools covered here (tangent plane, total differential, linearization for approximation, differentiabilty, locally linear) but these tools are introduced and defined in such a way that each conceptually flows from the idea of locally linear functions.

  <subsection>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      Throughout your work in single variable calculus, the tangent line has served as a geometric and conceptual tool to understand the derivative at a point. While the value of a derivative at a point measures the instantaneous rate of change, we visualized the value of the derivative as the slope of the line tangent to the graph of our function. This allowed use to <q>see</q> the value of the derivative in terms of an important behavior of the function's graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we saw the correspondence between a function's graph being <em>locally linear</em><idx><h>locally linear</h></idx> and the function being differentiable. If we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function around a point, then the graph will look like the tangent line to the function at that point. <xref ref="LLline2" /> shows the graph of a curve with sliders that allow you to to zoom in around the labeled point on the curve or change the location for the labeled point on the curve. The displayed function's graph is differentiable because at every point on the curve, you can zoom-in around the labeled point and the graph of the function will look linear (for a small region around the point). You should visually verify at several points that this function is differentiable at the labeled point by verifying the graph is locally linear.

      When viewing our differentiable function on a very small scale, the graph will be very close to the graph of the tangent line. Thus we can use the derivative as the slope of our tangent line in order to measure how tilted our graph is on a small scale. Because the graph of the function and the tangent line are so similar for a small region around the given point, the tangent line will allow us to approximate the output value of the function or the change in the output value for inputs near the given point. Tangent lines were used in many different applications and extensions of derivatives; For example, horizontal tangent lines gave critical points for optimization problems and tangent lines were used to approximate zeros or roots of functions when developing the Newton-Raphson Method. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      In <xref ref="tangentlines"/>, we saw that a curve in space, as the graph of a vector-valued function of one variable, would be locally linear and approximated well by a tangent line if the function was differentiable. So a curve in space/vector-valued function will be differentiable if the graph looks like a line on a small scale.
    </p>  
    <p>
      In this section, we will explore the various ways in which we can extend the ideas described above to a function of two variables. Geometrically, this means we will use a tangent plane as a <q>flat</q> analog for surfaces of the form <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.
      <fn>
        For graphs in the cartesian plane, there was only one type of flat graph, i.e. a line. When we generalized to higher dimensions, we saw how lines and planes would be considered flat graphs but lines would be considered a 1-dimensional flat graph (because there is only direction to move along the graph) and planes would be considered a 2-dimensional flat graph.
      </fn>
      We will also introduce a couple of new tools to help us describe change in the output of <m>f(x,y)</m> algebraically and numerically.

In <xref ref="LLline2" /> you can look at the graph of a curve and zoom in around a point on that curve to see that eventually the graph of the function will look linear. You can use the sliders above the plot to change how closely zoomed in the plot will be or change the location on the curve that you are examining. You should visually verify at a several points that this function is differentiable because at any point shown, the graph is locally linear.

      Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function (or a differentiable vector-valued function of one variable) looks like a line when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable function looks like a plane, as seen in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_4">Figure</xref>. In the following preview activity, we will explore how to state an equation for this plane in terms of values related to our function <m>f(x,y)</m>.

    <title>Differentiability and Local Linearity</title>
    <p>
      Before we state a general formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a particular point on the graph of <m>z=f(x,y)</m>, we will discuss a technical condition and look at a couple of examples of functions that are NOT locally linear.
    </p>
    <p>  
      As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a <q>nice</q> single-variable function on a small scale near a point <m>x_0</m>, we expect to see a line; in this case, we say that <em><m>f</m> is locally linear near <m>x_0</m></em> since the graph looks like a linear function locally around <m>x_0</m>. Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by <m>f(x)=|x|</m>, that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function <em><m>f</m> is locally linear<idx><h>function</h><h>locally linear</h></idx> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m></em> provided that the graph of <m>f</m> looks like a plane (its <em>tangent plane</em>) when viewed on a small scale near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. How can we tell when a function of two variables is locally linear at a point?
    </p>
    <example>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If you looked at a graph of the function <m>f(x,y)=|x|+|y|</m>, you would see that no matter how much you zoom in around the origin (or any point on the surface with either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> zero), the surface will never look like a plane. This function is continuous at every point, but neither partial derivative will be defined when either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> are zero.

      It would take us too far afield to provide a rigorous discussion of differentiability of functions of more than one variable (but <xref ref="Ez_10_4_4">Exercise</xref> covers some of these details). We will be content to define a stronger, but more easily verified, set of conditions that ensure local linearity.

    <p>
      Whenever a function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> is continuously differentiable at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, it follows that the function has a tangent plane at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. This means that when viewed up close, the tangent plane and the graph of the function are virtually indistinguishable. We won't formally define differentiability of multivariable functions in this text. For our purposes, continuous differentiability is the only condition we will need to use. It is important to note that continuous differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to continuously differentiable functions.

        <em>Important Note:</em> As can be seen in <xref ref="Ez_10_4_0">Exercise</xref>, it is possible that <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> exist for a function <m>f</m> (and so the plane <m>z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m> exists) even though <m>f</m> is <em>not</em> locally linear at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. The graph of <m>f</m> (<xref ref="x13y13" />) does not look linear when we zoom in around the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, so the plane given is not <q>tangent</q> to the graph. Differentiability for a function of two variables implies the existence of a tangent plane, but the existence of the two first order partial derivatives of a function at a point does not imply differentiability. This is quite different than what happens in single variable calculus, where the derivative existing is equivalent to the function being locally linear. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having the equation for a tangent plane in the form given by <m>z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m> will allow us to quickly state some important information about the function <m>f</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. For example, if we have a particular tangent plane given by <m>z = 7 - 2(x-3) + 4(y+1)</m>, then we can immediately read from this form that <m>f_x(3,-1) = -2</m> and <m>f_y(3,-1) = 4</m>; furthermore, <m>f_x(3,-1)=-2</m> is the slope of the trace to both <m>f</m> and the tangent plane in the <m>x</m>-direction at <m>(3,-1)</m>. In the same way, <m>f_y(3,-1) = 4</m> is the slope of the trace of both <m>f</m> and the tangent plane in the <m>y</m>-direction at <m>(3,-1)</m>.

    <title>Linearization</title>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is to approximate a differentiable function. Near the point <m>x_0</m>, the tangent line (to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x_0</m>) is close to the graph of <m>f</m> for input values close to <m>x_0</m>, as shown in <xref ref="LL2">Figure</xref>. If you use the zoom slider, you can look at small region around the highlighted point to see how the tangent line is a good approximation for a small region around the highlighted point. In fact, the smaller the scale around the point, the better the approximation is.

    <p>
      In this single-variable setting, we let <m>L</m> denote the function whose graph is the tangent line, and thus
      <me>
        L(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
      </me>
      Furthermore, observe that <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> near <m>x_0</m>. We call <m>L</m> the <em>linearization</em> of <m>f</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provides a good approximation of <m>f(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>. Here, we define the <term>linearization</term>, <m>L</m>, to be the two-variable function whose graph is the tangent plane. Thus
      <men xml:id="linearizationeqn">
        L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)
      </men>
      Finally, note that <m>f(x,y)\approx L(x,y)</m> for points near <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>, which is illustrated in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_9">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      Using the linearization may seem like a needless complication to your life, but in many applications the actual function you are interested in is unknown. For instance, if you were working for a mining company and were trying to map a pocket of some resource underground, it would be <em>very</em> expensive to drill out a bunch of samples to make a chart with amounts of the resource at a grid of locations. You would want to get the most information possible and be able to estimate between the locations where you took data. This is where the linearization is a valuable first step in determining a way to estimate between different input locations. In later courses (like differential equations or numerical methods), you may encounter more sophisticated ways to estimate between data points and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these ideas. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        In this example, we will give the equation of the tangent plane to <m>f(x,y)=6-\frac{x^2}{2}-y^2</m> at the point <m>(1,1)</m>, state the associated linearization, and use this linearization to estimate the output of <m>f</m> for a nearby input. Our first partial derivatives of <m>f</m> will be <m>f_x=-x</m> and <m>f_y=-2y</m> which take values of <m>f_x(1,1)=-1</m> and <m>f_y(1,1)=-2</m> for our point of interest. Using <m>f(1,1)=4.5</m>, the tangent plane to <m>f</m> at the point <m>(1,1)</m> will be given by <m>z=4.5+(-1)(x-1)+(-2)(y-1)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The linearization of <m>f</m> at (1,1) will be <m>L(x,y)=4.5+(-1)(x-1)+2(y-1)</m>. Notice that the same information is used to find the tangent plane and the linearization; the tangent plane is a geometric tool and the linearization is a function/algebraic tool, where both describe <m>f</m> near (1,1). We can use the Linearization to estimate what <m>f(0.9,1.2)</m> would be.
        <me>f(0.9,1.2) \approx L(0.9,1.2) = 4.5+(-1)(0.9-1)+(-2)(1.2-1) = 4.5+(0.1)-0.4=4.8</me>
        Because we have the algebraic form of our function would could have evaluated <m>f(0.9,1.2)</m> but as the next activity shows, many applications of multivariable functions use tables or graphs where it is not possible to have the function's output at every possible point.

          Since <m>g(0.8,2.3) \approx 0.135</m>, we have a fair approximation. This should be expected since the step sizes of 0.2 and 0.3 are not that small.

      As we have seen, the linearization <m>L(x,y)</m> allows us to estimate the value of <m>f(x,y)</m> for points <m>(x,y)</m> near the base point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>. Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the <em>change</em> in <m>f</m> as we move from the base point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to another
      point <m>(x,y)</m>.

    <p>
      <xref ref="F_10_4_differential">Figure</xref> illustrates the change in the output of <m>f</m> that we are looking for as <m>\Delta f</m> in blue. Specifically, we want to look at the change near the input <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and we know the value <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m>. If we consider the displacement <m>\langle \Delta x, \Delta y\rangle</m> to a new point <m>(x,y) = (x_0+\Delta x, y_0 + \Delta y)</m>, we would like to know how much the output of the function <m>f</m> has changed. We denote this change by <m>\Delta f</m>, where
      <me>
        \Delta f = f(x,y) - f(x_0, y_0)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple way to estimate the change <m>\Delta f</m> is to approximate it by <m>df</m>, which represents the change in the linearization <m>L(x,y)</m> as we move from
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m>. This gives
      <md>
        <mrow>\Delta f \approx df \amp = L(x,y)-L(x_0, y_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = [f(x_0,y_0)+ f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)] - f(x_0, y_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = f_x(x_0,y_0)\Delta x + f_y(x_0, y_0)\Delta y</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      For consistency, we will denote the change in the independent variables as <m>dx = \Delta x</m> and <m>dy = \Delta y</m> because the change in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates are the same whether we use the function <m>f</m> or the linearization <m>L</m>. Thus,
      <men xml:id="E_10_4_differential">
        \Delta f \approx df = f_x(x_0,y_0) dx + f_y(x_0,y_0) dy
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have
      <men xml:id="E_10_4_differential_leib">
        df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} dy.
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      We call the quantities <m>dx</m>, <m>dy</m>, and <m>df</m> <em>differentials</em><idx><h>differentials</h></idx>, and we think of them as measuring small changes in the quantities <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>f</m>. Equations <xref ref="E_10_4_differential"/> and <xref ref="E_10_4_differential_leib"/> express the relationship between these changes. Equation <xref ref="E_10_4_differential_leib"/> resembles an important idea from single-variable calculus: when <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>, it follows in the notation of differentials that
      <me>
        dy = y' dx = \frac{dy}{dx} dx.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will illustrate the use of differentials with an example. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Suppose we have a machine that cuts rectangles of width <m>x=20</m> cm and height <m>y=10</m> cm. However, the machine isn't perfect, and therefore the width could be off by <m>dw = \Delta w = 0.2</m> cm and the height could be off by <m>dh = \Delta h = 0.4</m> cm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area of the rectangle is
        <me>
          A(w,h) = wh,
        </me>
        so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is <m>A(20, 10) = 200</m> square centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would like to know how much the area of a given rectangle could differ from the perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using <xref ref="E_10_4_differential"/>, and find that
        <me>
          \Delta A \approx dA = A_w(20, 10) \enspace dw + A_h(20,10)\enspace dh
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>A_w = h</m> and <m>A_h = w</m>, we have
        <me>
          \Delta A \approx dA = 10 \enspace dw + 20 \enspace dh = 10 (0.2) + 20 (0.4) = 10
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by as much as 10 square centimeters.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can easily apply our differential for a different sized box as well. If we wanted to make boxes with width of 63 cm and height of 25 cm and our machines had the same tolerances (<m>dw = \Delta w = 0.2</m> cm and <m>dh = \Delta h = 0.4</m> cm), then our target box would have area 1,575 square centimeters but the uncertainty in the area would be <m>30.2 cm^2</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow> \Delta A \approx dA =\amp A_w(63, 25) \enspace dw + A_h(63,25) \enspace dh</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=  25 dw + 63 dh</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= 25 (0.2) + 63 (0.4) = 30.2 </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      In the next activity, we will explore the differential in several different contexts. We will take a moment here to point out some of the differences in meaning and usage between the change in the output of a function, the linearization, and the differential. In particular, we will look back at <xref ref="F_10_4_differential" />, <xref ref="E_10_4_differential" />, and <xref ref="linearizationeqn" />.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The linearization of a function at a point is the algebraic function equivalent to the tangent plane at that point. If a function is <q>nice</q> (meaning differentiable or continuously differentiable), then the tangent plane/linearization will be close to the actual function on a small neighborhood around the base point. This gives us a geometric (tangent plane) and a numerical (linearization) tool to estimate our function's outputs in a small region around the point of interest.
    </p>
    <p>  
      As <xref ref="F_10_4_differential" /> shows visually, the difference between our functions output at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>(x,y)</m> is given by <m>\Delta f</m> whereas the difference between the linearization at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>(x,y)</m> is given by <m>df</m>. If we look at a small enough scale, the difference between the differential and <m>\Delta f</m> will be small. The differential is a primarily algebraic tool that will allow us to talk how the change in the output of our function will vary depending on the location we want to look at (<m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m>) and how much change we will allow in the input variables (<m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m>).

            The wind chill is <m>w(25,-15) = -44^{\circ}F</m>. But since <m>dT = 2</m> and <m>dv = 3</m>, our wind chill measurement has an error of

      We will take a moment here to point out an idea that was used throughout this section and will be used time and again in this chapter. For a <q>nice</q> function (locally linear/differentiable/continuously differentiable), the rate of change in the output of the function as you approach a point will be same as the rate of change along the linearization. In other words, we can approximate change near a point by looking at the change on the linearization; we can also evaluate the rates of changes along our surface by evaluating the corresponding change on the linearization and regardless of the direction, these rates of change will be the same at the base point.

      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables is locally linear at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> if the graph of <m>z=f(x,y)</m> looks like a plane as we zoom in on the graph (around the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>).  In this case, the equation of the tangent plane is given by
          <me>
            z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The function <m>L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m> is called the linearization of a differentiable function <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and may be used to estimate values of <m>f(x,y)</m>;  that is, <m>f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)</m> for points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. The graph of the linearization function is the tangent plane.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that both <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The differential <m>df</m> of a function <m>f= f(x,y)</m> is related to the differentials <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> by
          <me>
            df = f_x(x_0,y_0) dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)dy.
          </me>
          We can use this relationship to approximate small changes in the output of <m>f</m> that results from small changes in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
