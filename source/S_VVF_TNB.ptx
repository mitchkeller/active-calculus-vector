    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S-VVF-Plotting" />, we saw how a vector-valued function of one variable will graphically correspond to a curve in space. While the application of derivatives, integrals, and limits apply to these functions componentwise, we will need to apply our calculus and vector tools <em>together</em> to measure  important properties of these curves. Conceptually, you should think about the parameterization of the curve in space as a description on how to travel through those points in space. Remember that parameterizations are not unique: there is more than one way to walk the same path!

      For example, consider the curve in space that we are exploring to be a race track as shown in <xref ref="rc-plot1" />. Not every driver will travel along this racetrack in the same way, but every driver has to go through these same points in space, since we assume that everyone will stay on the track and not take shortcuts. In the vocabulary of this chapter, any parameterization of this curve has to contain the same points, but can possibly go through these <m>(x,y,z)</m>-coordinates at different parameter values. More generally, some properties we measure will depend on the particular way that a driver goes along the course and some properties will be the same for all drivers when measured at the same location on the track.

          As CEO and Head of Engineering at <em>Steer Clear</em>, you decide that you are almost ready to start testing your self-driving car out on the road. Your navigation and telemetry software will use the location tracking system (LTS) to determine all of the important information about how the car is moving and how adjustments need to be made. Before you start programming your software, you decide to drive on a quiet, country road and collect data from the LTS to use as test data for your programming. In other words, you will drive on a section of road you already have mapped out in order to check that your software is calculating the correct information. The map in <xref ref="fig-vvf-tnb-country-road" /> below shows the path you plan to take on the country road (with the direction given by the arrows on the plot). Notice that at points <m>B</m> and <m>F</m>, the road crosses itself to go in a different direction.

      <xref ref="PA-vvf-tnb"/> highlights the intuitive nature of measuring the direction of travel and the direction of turning given a plot of a curve in space. We will now look at how to use location information in the form of a parameterization of a curve to precisely measure the direction of travel and the direction of turning at a particular point on the curve.

    <title>Direction of travel</title>
    <p>
      Based on our work in <xref ref="vvf-derivative" />, if <m>\vr(t)</m> is a parameterization of a curve in space, then the velocity vector, <m>\vv(t)=\vr\, '(t)</m>, is in the direction of travel. Since the speed, <m>\vecmag{\vv(t)}</m>, is not always 1 (the velocity is not always a unit vector), we define the <term>direction of travel</term> using a unit vector as follows.
    </p>
      <definition xml:id="def-unit-tangent">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The <term>unit tangent vector</term> to a curve, denoted <m>\vT(t)</m>, is defined as 
            <me> \vT(t)=\frac{\vv(t)}{\vecmag{\vv(t)}}</me>
            and measures the direction of travel along a parameterized curve.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
    <p>
      By definition, the unit tangent vector exists as long as the velocity exists and is not the zero vector. If the velocity vector is <m>\vec{0}</m>, then the object is not moving, thus the direction of travel would not make sense at that instant. If there is a jump or discontinuity in the derivative of <m>\vr</m> so that <m>\vv</m> does not exist, the direction of travel at that instant does not make sense because there is not a consistent way to define how the object is moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of <m>\vT</m> allows us to separate the velocity of a moving object into its magnitude (speed) and direction (unit tangent). Using a unit vector allows us to express the direction of travel as a vector that is separate of the length of any related measurements. Remember that <m>\vT</m> changes along the curve and is calculated as a function of the parameter.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="helix-T">
      <p>
        For our first example, we will look computing the unit tangent vector of a helix. In particular, we will look at the helix traced out by <m>\vr(t)=\langle \cos(t),\sin(t),\frac{t}{\pi}\rangle </m>, which is shown in <xref ref="helix-plot1"/>.

      <p>
        Based on the parameterization <m>r(t)</m> for this helix, the velocity vector is <m>\vv(t)=\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle </m>. Thus, the speed is
        <me>\text{speed}(t) = \vecmag{\vv(t)} = \sqrt{\left(-\sin(t)\right)^2+\left(\cos(t)\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right)^2}= \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}</me>.
        One of the useful and interesting ideas of this example is that the speed is constant. That is, no matter what parameter value we consider, the speed is always <m> \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}} </m>. Using <xref ref="def-unit-tangent" />, we find
        <me> \vT(t)= \frac{\vv(t)}{\vecmag{{\vv(t)}}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle </me>. To compute some specific examples, we have
        <md>
          <mrow>\vT\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\amp=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\left\langle -1,0,\frac{1}{\pi} \right\rangle</mrow>
          <mrow>\vT\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) \amp=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{1}{\pi} \right\rangle</mrow>
        </md>.
        In <xref ref="helix-plot2" />, <m>\vT(\frac{\pi}{2})</m> is plotted in red and <m>\vT(\frac{5\pi}{4})</m> is plotted in blue. Both of these vectors are unit length and tangent to the curve in the direction of travel for that instant.

        Note that we can also find <m>\vT(\frac{\pi}{2})</m> by computing <m>\vv(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \langle -1,0,\frac{1}{\pi} \rangle </m> and shrinking this vector to be a unit vector. Because our definitions and theorems work for all values of <m>t</m>, we can apply them at a specific value of <m>t</m>. This has the added advantage that computations tend to be manageable when done by hand. The downside to this calculation is that you only have information for the one parameter value. This will only useful for finding information at a fixed value of <m>t</m> because you are not concerned with how the measurement is done for other parameter values.

    <title>The Direction of Turning</title>
    <p>
      Recalling our analogy in which we think of a parameterization as describing how someone drives along a racetrack, we say that <m>\vT</m> measures the direction that the car is heading at any given instant. If we use the curve plotted in <xref ref="rc-plot2" /> as an example of the racetrack, then <m>\vT(2)\approx \langle -0.8813, -0.4691, 0.0568 \rangle</m>. The plot in <xref ref="rc-plot2" /> shows how the direction of travel corresponds to the curve at the point <m>\vr(2)</m>. What direction is the car turning at <m>t=2</m>? You can see by the plot that the car will be be turning left, but that is a direction relative to the car. We wish to measure the direction that the car is turning at this instant in terms of the locations given by the parameterization in an <m>xyz</m>-coordinate system?

      We first consider <m>\vT\, '=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m>, which measures how quickly <m>\vT</m> is changing in terms of the parameter. The vector <m>\vT\, '=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> will measure the rate of change of the direction of travel. Since vectors have magnitude and direction, the derivative of a vector-valued function measures both the change in the magnitude <em>and</em> the change in the direction. Since <m>\vT</m> will always have length 1 (when <m>\vT</m> exists), <em>all</em> of the change in <m>\vT</m> corresponds to a change in direction. Thus, the direction of <m>\vT'=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> will be exactly what we are looking for: <m>\vT\, '</m> will point in the direction of turning. For now, we don't care about how fast the car is turning; we want to find the direction of the turning. This leads us to define the unit normal vector, denoted <m>\vN</m>, as the unit vector in the direction of <m>\vT\, '</m>.

      In this example, we will calculate the unit normal vector for a helical path given by <m>\vr(t)=\langle \cos(t),\sin(t),\frac{t}{\pi}\rangle </m>. This is the same path as was used in <xref ref="helix-T"/> and was plotted in <xref ref="helix-plot1"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From our work in <xref ref="helix-T" />, we calculated
      <me> \vT(t)= \frac{\vv(t)}{\vecmag{{\vv(t)}}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\left\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \right\rangle </me>
      Using the definition of <m>\vN</m>, we need to compute the derivative of <m>\vT</m> with respect to <m>t</m>:
      <me> \vT\, '(t)=\frac{d\vT}{dt}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0 \rangle </me>
      Note that in this example, the derivative of <m>\vT</m> is easily calculated for all time values but this will rarely be the case. Further, making a unit vector in the direction of <m>\vT(t)'=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m> is routine and gives us the following calculation:
      <md>
        <mrow> \vec{N}(t) \amp= \frac{\vT\, '(t)}{\vecmag{{\vT'(t)}}} </mrow>
        <mrow>            \amp= \frac{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(1/\pi^)}}\langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0 \rangle }{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+1/(\pi^2)}}} </mrow>
        <mrow>            \amp=  \langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0 \rangle </mrow>
      </md> 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can calculate <m>\vN(\frac{\pi}{2})=\langle 0,-1,0 \rangle</m> and <m>\vN(\frac{5\pi}{4})=\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},0 \rangle</m>. If we add these vectors to the plot of the helix with the unit tangent vectors, as in <xref ref="helix-plot2" />, we can see that the direction of turning (as measured by <m>\vN</m>) is pointing toward the center of the helix. It should make sense the the direction you are turning to stay on the helix is toward the inside of the circular trace. Note that the unit tangent vector has a vertical component which corresponds to going <q>up</q> the helix but there is no vertical component to <m>\vN</m>. This is because there is vertical motion, but there is no <em>turning</em> in the vertical direction. That is, the <m>z</m>-component of <m>\vT</m> is unchanging, which means that the vertical component of <m>\vT\, '</m> must be be zero.

  As talked about in <xref ref="subsec-unit-tangent" />, the unit tangent vector <m>\vT</m> measures the direction of <em>travel</em> along a parameterized curve. The unit normal vector <m>\vN</m> measures the direction that an object is <em>turning</em> in order to stay on the curve. In <xref ref="helix-plot3" />, we observed that the unit tangent and unit normal vectors as at each point along the curve were orthogonal to each other.
</p>
<question>
  <p>
    Can <m>\vN</m> have any part parallel to <m>\vT</m> or must <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> be orthogonal?
  </p>
</question>
<p>
  We first answer this question with a conceptual, geometric argument. By <xref ref="def-unit-normal" />, the unit normal vector is parallel to <m>\vT\, '=\frac{d\vT}{dt}</m>. The derivative of the unit tangent vector will measure the change in <m>\vT</m>, and since <m>\vT</m> is a vector, this includes change in both the magnitude and the direction of <m>\vT</m>. Since the length of <m>\vT</m> does not change, <em>all</em> of <m>\vT\, '</m> represents change in the direction of <m>\vT</m>. This is an intuitive argument for why <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal. We next state this formally for future reference and present a formal, algebraic argument.
</p>
<proposition xml:id="TdotNzero">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The unit tangent vector <m>\vT</m> and the unit normal vector <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal so that 
      <me>
        \vT\cdot \vN = 0
      </me>.
      
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Here we give a rigorous, algebraic argument. However, this argument does not provide insight into the measurements or relationship between <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> that the paragraph before this Key Idea presents. For this algebraic argument, we consider at the derivative of <m>\vecmag{\vT}^2</m>. Because the length of <m>\vT</m> is constant, we must have that <m> \frac{d}{dt}\left(\vecmag{\vT}^2 \right)=0</m>. To simplify <m> \frac{d}{dt}\left(\vecmag{\vT}^2 \right)</m>, we use properties of the dot product related to the magnitude, the derivative product rule for the dot product, and finall  the commutative property of the dot product. Hence, we see
      <md>
        <mrow> \frac{d}{dt}\left(\vecmag{ \vT }^2 \right) \amp=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\vT \cdot \vT \right)  </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= \vT' \cdot \vT + \vT \cdot \vT' </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= 2 \vT \cdot \vT'</mrow>
      </md>
      If <m>0=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\vecmag{\vT}^2\right) = 2 \vT \cdot \vT'</m>, then <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vT'</m> are orthogonal. Since <m>\vN</m> is parallel to <m>\vT'</m>, we must also have that <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are orthogonal.

  <title>The Binormal Vector</title>
  <p>
    Since the title of this section is <xref ref="S-VVF-TNB" text="title"/> and we have defined <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>, you likely are expecting the definition of a vector called <m>\vB</m>, which we do in this subsection. Since we saw in <xref ref="TdotNzero"/> that the unit tangent and unit normal vectors are orthogonal, this final vector will be defined in a way that completes a right-handed coordinate system with <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-binormal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>binormal vector</term>, denoted <m>\vec{B}</m>, for a parameterized curve is defined as <me> \vec{B}=\vT \times \vec{N}</me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition of <m>\vB</m> creates a three-dimensional right-handed coordinate system that is relative to the motion along the curve. Notice that while we had to divide by magnitude to ensure that <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> were unit vectors, the binormal vector is a unit vector because <m>\vecmag{\vT \times \vN } = \vecmag{\vT} \vecmag{\vN} \sin(\theta)</m> where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m>. Since <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are unit vectors and orthogonal to each other, we see that <m>\vecmag{\vT}\vecmag{\vN} \sin(\theta)= 1</m>. The binormal vector <m>\vB</m> gives the axis of rotation for the motion along the curve. This measure of rotation follows our right-handed measure of rotation. If you put the fingers of your right hand in the direction of travel (<m>\vT</m>) and curl your fingers in the direction of turning (<m>\vN</m>), then your thumb will correspond to the axis of rotation based on how you are moving along the curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <term>TNB frame</term> is also called the <term>Frenet frame</term><idx><h>frame</h><h>TNB</h></idx><idx><h>frame</h><h>Frenet</h></idx><idx><h>TNB frame</h></idx><idx><h>Frenet frame</h></idx> and is frequently used in fields such as aviation and space travel because much of the important flight information is expressed in terms of relative measurements to the craft and its motion.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      In this example, we complete the  calculation of the TNB frame for the helix given by <m>\vr(t)=\langle \cos(t),\sin(t)\frac{t}{\pi}\rangle </m>. From <xref ref="helix-T" /> and <xref ref="helix-N" /> we have the following:
        <md>
          <mrow> \vT(t) \amp= \frac{\vv(t)}{\vecmag{{\vv(t)}}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}}\left\langle -\sin(t),\cos(t),\frac{1}{\pi} \right\rangle </mrow>
          <mrow> \vN \amp= \langle -\cos(t),-\sin(t),0\rangle </mrow>
        </md> 
      Using the definition for <m>\vB</m>, we have
      <me> \vB = \vT \times \vN = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\pi^2}}} \left\langle -\frac{1}{\pi}\sin(t), -\frac{1}{\pi}\cos(t), \sin(t)^2+\cos(t)^2 \right\rangle </me>
      Factoring out <m>\frac{1}{\pi}</m> from each component and simplifying the coefficient gives
      <me> \vB = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2+1}} \langle -\sin(t), -\cos(t), \pi \rangle  </me>.

      Note that as you change the <m>t</m>-value and move around the helix, the unit tangent points in the direction of travel, the unit normal points in the direction the object is turning (always to the left while going up the helix), and the binormal vector is the axis of rotation for the <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> vectors. If you curl the fingers on your right hand from the direction of <m>\vT</m> toward the direction of <m>\vN</m>, notice that your thumb will point in the direction of <m>\vB</m>.

  <title>The Driver or the Road: TNB Frame</title>
  <p>
    To conclude this section, we consider whether the measurements of <m>\vT</m>, <m>\vN</m>, and <m>\vB</m> are properties of the driver or the road. A parameterized curve  has a stated orientation (direction of travel). Remember that a measurement involving a parameterized curve is a property of the driver if two different parameterizations can have different measurements at the same location on the curve. It is important to remember that this does not mean that you look at the same parameter value on the curve, but rather the same <em>location</em> on the curve. A measurement on a parameterized curve is a property of the road if <em>every</em> parameterization of this curve must have the same measurement for a fixed location on the curve. These are the same ideas that were first discussed in <xref ref="driver_road_act" />. In the analogy of a parameterization being a description for how a particular racecar travels around a track as a function of time, a measurement is a property of the driver if that measurement can have different values for different drivers when measured at the same point on the racetrack. A measurement is a property of the road if that measurement <em>must</em> have the same value for <em>all</em> drivers when measured at the same point on the racetrack.

      <li>
        <p>
          The binormal vector, <m>\vB(t)= \vT \times \vN</m>, is the direction of the axis for which <m>\vT</m> and <m>\vN</m> are rotating around.
