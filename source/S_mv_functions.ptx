      This section expects students to have familiarity with our discussion of 3D coordinates and fundamental planes in <xref ref="S-Precalc-3Dcoord"/> and properties of functions from precalculus (domain, range, etc.). This section can probably be covered in in a single class meeting but students will need to practice with the ideas of traces and contour plots since those will be used throughout the next three chapters. 
    </p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>
      For much of your study of algebra, precalculus, and calculus you have been focused on working with functions that have a scalar input and a scalar output, like <m>y=f(x)</m>. In <xref ref="C_VVF"/>, we used vector-valued functions of one variable as our first case of multivariable functions. Vector-valued functions of one variable have a single scalar input and an output corresponding to multiple variables that we either organized as a vector output such as <m>\vr(t)=\langle x(t),y(t),z(t) \rangle</m> or as parametric functions of the form (<m>x(t)</m>, <m>y(t)</m>, and <m>z(t)</m>) . Our work in <xref ref="C_VVF" /> focused on paths in space and the motion of an object on these paths. This narrow focus was because we had just one direction to move while staying on the path. We worked with vector-valued functions of one variable as our first new class of functions because the calculus of these object was relatively easy. We applied limits, derivatives, and integrals to these functions componentwise, but we saw how useful a combination of vector tools and calculus measurements was for describing many features of vector-valued functions of one variable and their graphs as paths in space. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A wide range of theoretical and applied problems involve a larger space of inputs and outputs. For instance, when studying weather patterns and behavior it is useful to measure temperature or atmospheric pressure. Both temperature and pressure are scalar measurements because they are measured by a single number. However, these measurements vary over three dimensions (north/south, east/west, and elevation). Temperature can be given by a function with a location in three dimensions as the input and the temperature at that location, a scalar, as an output. Wind direction and strength are also very important when working with weather patterns. Because it has both magnitude and direction, wind is measured with a vector that varies with location in a three-dimensional space. Therefore, wind would be given by a function that takes a location in space as its input and that outputs a vector. We would call both the temperature and the wind functions <term>functions of several variables</term> or <term>multivariable functions</term> because each of these functions has multiple scalar inputs. We will look at the calculus of multivariable functions with scalar outputs such as temperature and pressure in this chapter and the next. The <xref ref="C_Vector">final chapter</xref> of the book studies functions with multivariable inputs <em>and</em> outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="C_VVF"/>, all of the applications and analogies were centered around an object moving along a curve in space. When working with functions of several variables, we will want to use a few different types of functions for our applications and examples because of the possible conceptual relationships between inputs and outputs. For instance, the first type of example we will consider is thinking of the elevation or height of land as being a function of map coordinates. In this case, the input and output are connected to make the surface and have the same units. In other words the input and output are each the same type of measurement and would be easily understood by the plot of a surface. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The example of temperature as a multivariable function as described above gives a different kind of interpretation, one in which the output is a different kind of measurement than the inputs. For instance, think of a function whose input is the <m>(x,y)</m> location on a heated metal plate and the output is the temperature of the metal plate at this location. In this case, the input is thought of as a point or location and the output is a measure of thermal energy at that location. The inputs and outputs are different kinds of measurements, but a plot of the different temperature values across the different <m>(x,y)</m> locations would still visually make sense. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also consider a function that describes the horizontal distance traveled by a arrow before the arrow hits the ground as determined by the angle at which the arrow is shot and the initial speed of the arrow. In this case, the input to our function is an angle and a speed, while the output is a distance representing horizontal displacement. In this case, the units and types of measurements for the inputs and outputs are all different, and a plot of the corresponding surface of displacement, angle, and speed values would be a more abstract visual representation than in the temperature and elevation examples. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next few chapters, we will use these types of examples, as well as applications to economics, to motivate our study of functions of several variables. Our preview activity will use a finance example to get you used to the notation and descriptions of different aspects of functions of several variables. 
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. Functions of several variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several variables. 
    </p> -->
    <!-- This preview activity is about getting students used to evaluating the function of several variables. I think this needs to be less generic and an introduction to one of the functions we will use as examples and applications throughout this chapter. Don't know that I care which one. -->

          Suppose you invest money in an account that pays 5% interest compounded continuously. If you have an initial investment of <m>P</m> dollars in the account, then <m>A</m>, the amount of money in the account after <m>t</m> years is given by

            As the amount of money initially invested increases, the length in time for the investment to reach $10,000 is less and less. Using Table 9.1.2, if the initial investment is around $6,000, it will take 10 years for the investment to reach $10,000. Algebraically, we can write this as <m>P=\frac{10,000}{e^{0.05t}}</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Functions of Several Variables</title>
    <p>
      Up to this chapter, we have primarily been concerned with functions of a single variable. Remember that a function is a rule that assigns exactly one output for each allowed input. For instance, the rule that assigns a student ID number to each student at your school is a function because each student (input) gets assigned one and only one ID number. The rule that assigns the classrooms for your courses this semester is <em>not</em> a function because you likely have more than one classroom (multiple outputs) for each student (a single input).
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw the behavior of a function in <xref ref="PA-mv_functions">Preview Activity</xref>, where each pair of inputs, <m>(P,t)</m>, produces a single output <m>A(P,t)</m>. Additionally, the values of the two variables <m>P</m> and <m>t</m> did not depend on one another. That is, we could choose any value of <m>P</m> without limiting what value <m>t</m> might have, and we could select any value of <m>t</m> to use without regard to what value <m>P</m> might have. For that reason we say that the variables <m>t</m> and <m>P</m> are <term>independent</term> of each other. Thus, we call <m>A = A(P,t)</m> a function of the two independent variables <m>P</m> and <m>t</m>. This is the key idea in defining a function of two independent variables. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>function <m>f</m> of two independent variables</term><idx><h>function</h><h>of two variables</h></idx> is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> in some set <m>D</m> exactly one real number <m>f(x,y)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      There is no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of only two variables; we can use any number of variables we like. For example,
      <me>
        f(x,y,z) = x^2 - 2xz + \cos(y)
      </me>
      defines <m>f</m> as a function of the three variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. In general, a function of <m>n</m> independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)</m> in some set <m>D</m> exactly one real number.
        <fn>You may notice that we use variable names like <m>x,y,z</m> when using three variables but when there are more than three variables, it will be convienent to index the variables like <m>x_i</m> so that we can refer to the variables by index. For example the fifth variable in <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)</m> will be <m>x_5</m> and the last two variables will be <m>x_{n-1}</m> and <m>x_n</m>. </fn>
    </p>

    <p>
      As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand the set of inputs for which the function is defined.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="domainrange_defn" >
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>domain</term><idx><h>function</h><h>domain</h></idx> of a function <m>f</m> is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>range</term><idx><h>function</h><h>range</h></idx> of a function <m>f</m> is the set of all actual outputs for the function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Recall that common ways for scalar functions to <em>not</em> be defined for a particular input include:

          Let <m>f(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}</m>. For the domain of <m>f</m> we can only use <m>(x,y)</m>-inputs where <m>\sqrt{xy}</m> is defined. This requires that <m>xy</m> be nonnegative. We will use set-builder notation to describe this domain. The domain of <m>f</m> is <m>\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\mid xy \geq 0\}</m>. This notation is read as <q>the set of <m>(x,y)</m> coordinates in the cartesian plane such that <m>x</m> times <m>y</m> is greater than or equal to zero</q>. Set builder notation is flexible because this follows the form <m>\{\text{kind of objects}\mid \text{conditions on objects}\}</m>. The symbol <m>|</m> is read as <q>such that</q>. Note that the domain of <m>f</m> does not say that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both nonnegative (quadrant I), but rather that the <em>product</em> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> needs to be nonnegative (quadrants I <em>and</em> III).

          When we consider the range of <m>f(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}</m> we need to think about what values can be outputs of <m>f</m>. You may be tempted to say that outputs are scalars, so the range should be all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. However, there is no way to get a negative output for <m>f</m>. Thus, not all real numbers are <em>actual</em> outputs of <m>f</m>. Instead, the range of <m>f</m> will be the interval <m>[0,\infty)</m> because those are the values that <m>f</m> actually outputs. (Specifically, for any nonnegative real number <m>c</m>, <m>f(c,c) = \sqrt{cc} = c</m>.)

          We now consider the domain and range of <m>g(x,y)=\frac{\arcsin(y)}{2x}</m>. First we need to recall the domain and range of the arcsine function are <m>[-1,1]</m> and <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>, respectively. Thus, the only valid inputs to <m>g</m> have <m>y</m>-values in the interval <m>[-1,1]</m> and we must also have <m>x\neq0</m> because we cannot divide by zero. Thus the domain of <m>g</m> is <m>\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2 \mid x \neq 0 \text{ and } -1 \leq y \leq 1\}</m>.

  <title>Representing Functions of Two Variables</title>
  <paragraphs>
    <title>Algebraic rules</title>
    <p>
      You have already seen one representation of a function of several variables: the algebraic notation <m>f(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}</m>, which shows an algebraic rule to find the output of the function <m>f</m> for given input values <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. This kind of representation is convenient to use with algebraic rules for derivatives or for computing the output of a function given particular inputs. The drawback to this representation is that you need a lot of intuition about the type of function being used to understand how the output changes over a range of values. 
    </p>

    <title>Tables</title>
    <p>
      One of the techniques we use to study functions of one variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for functions of two variables, except that our tables must allow us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a two-dimensional table, where we list the <m>x</m>-values down the first column and the <m>y</m>-values across the first row. 
    </p> 
  <p>
    As an example, suppose we launch a projectile (perhaps by hitting a golf ball with a golf club) from ground level. Under ideal conditions, by which we mean ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity, the horizontal distance the object travels before hitting the ground depends on the initial velocity <m>x</m> the object is given, and the angle <m>y</m> at which it is launched. If we let <m>f</m> represent the horizontal distance the object travels, then <m>f</m> is a function of the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and we represent <m>f</m> in functional notation by
    <me>
      f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{g}
    </me>,
    where <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity.<fn>Note that <m>g</m> is constant, <m>9.8</m> meters per second squared or <m>32</m> feet per second squared.</fn> To create a table of values for <m>f</m>, we list the <m>x</m>-values down the first column and the <m>y</m>-values across the first row. The value <m>f(x,y)</m> is  displayed in the location where the <m>x</m> row intersects the <m>y</m> column, as shown in <xref ref="T-mv_functions-range">Table</xref>, where we measure <m>x</m> in feet per second and <m>y</m> in radians. For example, <m>f(75,0.8)=175.7</m> is shown in the table by looking at the value in the row with <m>x=75</m> and column corresponding to <m>y=0.8</m>.

    Representing a function with a table should reinforce the idea that each of the two independent values for the input variables will have a corresponding output value. However, it is normal to feel that using the table provides little insight into the relationship described by the function when looking at a large table of values. Additionally, the table is only useful for the input values selected in the rows and columns. While this may seem like a very limited use case, many applied problems involve tables like this because an algebraic function can be extremely difficult to find for every case and it can be very expensive to test many input values to obtain the corresponding output values. You likely have already used spreadsheets to organize information in a multivariable setting like this.

    <title>Graphs</title>
  <p>
    If <m>f</m> is a function of a single variable <m>x</m>, then we define the graph of <m>f</m> to be the set of points of the form <m>(x,f(x))</m>, where <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>. We then plot these points using the coordinate axes in order to visualize the graph. We can do a similar thing with functions of several variables. <xref ref="T-mv_functions-range">Table</xref> identifies points of the form <m>(x,y,f(x,y))</m>, and we define the graph of <m>f</m> to be the set of these points in <m>\R^</m>.

Points of  the form <m>(x,y,f(x,y))</m> are in three dimensions. If we consider the graph of the distance function defined by <m>f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}</m>, then the function <m>f</m> is continuous in both variables. When these points are plotted in the rectangular coordinate system, the points form a surface in three-dimensional space. The graph of the distance function <m>f</m> is shown in <xref ref="zfnxy">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces as indicated in the Preface and most of the in-text three-dimensional graphics are generated by SageMath. Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two independent variables using plots in three dimensions, but not functions of more than two variables, we will primarily deal with functions of two variables in this chapter. It is important to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any number of variables and we will highlight these extensions to higher dimensions in <xref ref="S-MV-HD" />.

      You may have noticed that we used the notation <m>z=f(x,y)</m> in the caption to <xref ref="zfnxy"/>, which is explicitly saying that we are viewing the <m>z</m>-coordinate in our plot as the output of the function <m>f</m>. In other words, only <m>(x,y,z)</m> points of the form <m>(x,y,f(x,y))</m> are part of the graph plotted. In some situations, it may be advantageous to express a graph of interest using a function with some input and output roles of in a different configuration of coordinates. For instance, the surface shown in <xref ref="yfnxz"/> cannot be expressed with the <m>z</m>-coordinate at a function of the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates because there would be more than one <m>z</m> coordinate associated to inputs such as <m>(x,y)=(0,1)</m>, as highlighted by the red points in the figure. The points on this surface can be expressed with <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> an <m>z</m>, however! Specifically <m>y=g(x,z) = \frac{x^2}{5}+z^2</m>. We will typically look at examples where <m>z</m> is expressed as a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, but you should think carefully if it is advantageous to consider a different coordinate view.

    <p>
      When studying functions of several variables, we are often interested in how each individual variable affects the function while the other variable is fixed. In <xref ref="PA-mv_functions">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the amount initially invested and the duration of the investment. However, if we fix the initial investment, the amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we fix the duration of the investment, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the initial investment. This idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of several variables.<fn> This will be the first of many times we will employ the following approach <image source="LBmeme.png"/>
</fn>
    </p>

    <p>
      As another example, consider again the distance function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}
      </me>,
      where <m>x</m> is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, <m>y</m> is the launch angle in radians, and <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at <m>y=0.6</m> radians, we can consider <m>f</m> a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{x^2}{32}\sin(2\cdot 0.6)
      </me>.
      Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we can consider the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this case we have
      <me>
        f(y) = \frac{150^2 \sin(2y)}{32}
      </me>.
      In <xref ref="trace2"/>, we show two plots. <xref ref="trace21"/> shows what happens when fixing <m>y=0.6</m>, while <xref ref="trace22"/> shows the two-dimensional graph obtained by fixing <m>x=150</m>.

      We can plot the curve from <xref ref="trace21"/> on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when <m>y = 0.6</m>, as shown in red in <xref ref="trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula for <m>f(x,0.6)</m> shows that <m>f</m> is quadratic in the <m>x</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.

      <xref ref="act-mv_functions-draw-trace"/> shows how drawing traces on a plot of a surface can give the viewer more information on the orientation of the graph. In <xref ref="traceonoff"/> you can see a plot of the surface generated in our projectile motion example. Without any of the traces drawn on the surface, it is difficult to understand the shape of the surface, and it would be even harder if not for the shading on the computer-generated graphics. You can click on the check box at the top of the figure to add traces to the plot. Notice how much easier it is to distinguish the shape of the surface at different points!

      When drawing plots by hand, it is important to use parallel structure to make it easier for the viewer to orient the traces as being in a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes. It may take time for you to feel confident drawing these kinds of features by hand. However, visual representations of surfaces and their features will be very valuable in our work for the next several chapters. We will continue to provide tips and suggestions to help you with your visualizations along the way.

      As you saw earlier in this section, traces give important information about how a slice of a surface looks like when holding one of the inputs constant. This corresponds to looking at the intersection of a fundamental plane of the form <m>x=a</m> or <m>y=b</m> with the surface given by <m>z=f(x,y)</m>. These fundamental planes are oriented vertically when we consider a conventional right-handed coordinate system. In this section, we will explore the intersection of a surface given by <m>z=f(x,y)</m> with a fundamental plane of the form <m>z=c</m>. This will correspond to looking at the points on the surface with a fixed height. Specifically these points will be the intersection of the surface with the fundamental plane <m>z=c</m>.

      You may have seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine Mountains in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in <xref ref="act-mv_functions-porcupine"/>.<fn>Map source: Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with permission of the Michigan DNR and Bob Wild.</fn> The curves on these maps show the locations with a particular elevation (as labeled on the curve). The amount of space between these curves also depicts the rate of change in elevation: curves on the topographic map that are close together signify steep ascents or descents, while curves that are far apart indicate slower changes in elevation. Thus, these topographic maps with curves of constant elevation can tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if <m>f(x,y)</m> represents the elevation at the point <m>(x,y)</m>, then each of the curves with constant elevation is the graph of an equation of the form <m>f(x,y) = k</m>, for some constant <m>k</m>.

      Curves on a surface that describe points at the same height or level are called <term>level curves</term> and as you saw in the topographic map above, a plot with level curves can be useful for representing information on a surface using just a two dimensional plot.

      Topographical maps can be used to create a three-dimensional surface from the two-dimensional contours or level curves. For example, level curves of the distance function defined by <m>f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{32}</m> plotted in the <m>xy</m>-plane are shown at in <xref ref="contour1">Figure</xref>. You can change the number of contours in the plot by moving the slider at the top of <xref ref="contour1">Figure</xref>. Additionally, you will sometimes see a legend for contours shown when different colors are used or a contour plot with different colors and shading filling in the region between contours. You can toggle these options in the contour plot below by clicking on the checkbox next to the different options.

      The use of level curves and traces can help us construct the graph of a function of two variables. For the surface definded by <m>z=f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{32}</m>, we can plot a grid of <m>x</m>-traces, <m>y</m>-traces, and contours to get a good idea of what the surface looks like as shown in <xref ref="contour3" />. If you compare the paths plotted in <xref ref="contour3" /> to <xref ref="zfnxy" />, you will see that the mesh shown on the surfaces in most plots <em>is</em> a grid of traces of contours and that is how the orientation of surfaces is typically drawn by computer-generated plots.

      Isotherms are another example of where you are likely to encounter level curves. Isotherms are a plot in which the curves on the map connect locations that have the same temperature. A plot with lots of isotherms will allow you to see how the temperature changes over a region.

      The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves in space. Traces are easier to parameterize as a curve in space because one input variable is fixed and the other input variable can act as the parameter. For example, the trace with <m>y=b</m> of the surface given by <m>z=f(x,y)</m> will be parameterized by <m>\vr(t)=\langle t,b,f(t,b)\rangle</m> because the <m>z</m>-coordinate can be expressed in terms of the fixed input value and the other input variable (as the parameter). Parameterizing contours, however, can be difficult and often relies on knowing the particular shape of the contours. Remember that it may not be possible to express a curve of the form <m> k=f(x,y)</m> with one coordinate as a function of the other.

      We end this section by considering a collection of functions and illustrating their surface graphs and contour plots. Many (but not all) of these surfaces will be familiar to you from <xref ref="S-Precalc-CommonGraphs"/>, so now you will have an opportunity to see how the contour plots relate to the analyses you did in that section.

          A function <m>f</m> of several variables is a rule that assigns a single number to an ordered collection of independent inputs.  The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A trace of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>z = f(x,c)</m> (for an <m>x</m>-trace) or <m>z = f(c,y)</m> (for a <m>y</m>-trace), where <m>c</m> is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.

          A level curve of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>k = f(x,y)</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function. A level curve is also called a contour.
