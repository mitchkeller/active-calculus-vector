    <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S-Precalc-Vectors" />, we considered vector addition and scalar multiplication algebraically and interpreted the corresponding geometric meaning. In this section, we will introduce the first of two types of vector multiplication that we will study. This multiplication produces a scalar that tells us a remarkable amount about the geometric relationship between the vectors that are multiplied. We will start investigating these properties in the Preview Activity, but first, we provide the definition of this form of multiplication for two-dimensional vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the two-dimensional vectors <m>\vu = \langle u_1,u_2\rangle</m> and <m>\vv = \langle v_1,v_2\rangle</m>. The <term>dot product</term> of <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is denoted <m>\vu\cdot\vv</m> and defined to be
      <me>
        \vu\cdot \vv = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2
      </me>.
      For instance, we have <m>\langle 2,-1\rangle\cdot \langle 1,4\rangle = 2\cdot 1 +(-1)\cdot 4 = -2</m>. At first glance, this may feel like we've <em>lost</em> information, as we have taken two objects with both magnitude and direction, multiplied them, and obtained a scalar. However, this scalar allows us to draw many useful conclusions, as you will now begin exploring.

          <p>
            When we look at vectors drawn with the same initial point, as you have done with the vectors in <xref ref="vec2Dblank"/>, we can consider the angle between two vectors to be the <em>smaller</em> angle formed by looking at them. This results in an angle between <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m> if we measure in radians or between <m>0^{\circ}</m> and <m>180^{\circ}</m> if we measure in degrees. Rather than measuring the angles between the vectors you've drawn in <xref ref="vec2Dblank"/> precisely, classify the angle between the pairs of vectors in the table in <xref ref="PA-dotproduct-compute" text="type-local"/> by writing acute, right, or obtuse in the <q>Angle Classification</q> column.

            When the angle between the vectors is acute, the dot product is positive. When the angle is obtuse, the dot product is negative. The dot product is <m>0</m> when the vectors are perpendicular.

            No. We computed that <m>\vu_1\cdot \vu_4 = -3 = \vu_2\cdot \vu_4</m>. However, looking at the draawing of the vectors, it appears that the angle between <m>\vu_1</m> and <m>\vu_4</m> is closer to <m>\pi/2</m> than to <m>\pi</m>. On the other hand, the angle between <m>\vu_2</m> and <m>\vu_4</m> appears to be close to <m>\pi</m>.

            Although the angle between a vector and itself is <m>0</m>, the dot product of a vector with itself can be computed. Compute <m>\vu_1\cdot \vu_1</m> and <m>\vu_2\cdot \vu_2</m> as well as the magnitude of <m>\vu_1</m> and <m>\vu_2</m>. What do you notice about the relationship between these values? Write a sentence explaining why this seems reasonable based on the way the dot product of a vector with itself and the magnitude of that vector are computed.

            <m>\vu_1\cdot \vu_1 = 5</m>, <m>\vu_2\cdot \vu_2 = 2</m>, <m>\vecmag{\vu_1} = \sqrt{5}</m>, <m>\vecmag{\vu_2} = \sqrt{2}</m>

The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of the vector's magnitude. This makes sense because the dot product of a vector with itself is exactly what appears under the radical in the magnitude formula.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-dotproduct"/>, you have started developing an understanding of how the dot product gives us information about the angle between two vectors in the plane. The rest of this section will formalize this idea about the dot product of two vectors and explore properties of this measurement.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>The Dot Product</title>
    <p>
      The idea of multiplying corresponding components of vectors and summing them can be extended to any dimension, which gives us the definition of the dot product. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>dot product</term><idx><h>dot product</h></idx> of vectors <m>\vu=\langle u_1, u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle</m> and <m>\vv=\langle v_1, v_2,\ldots,v_n \rangle</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the scalar 
          <me>
            \vu\cdot\vv = u_1v_1+u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <aside>
      <p>
        As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural to define the dot product in this context. However, it is more convenient from a mathematical perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then view work as an application of this definition.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <p>
      To illustrate the idea of computing a dot product in more than three dimensions, we find that
      <md>
        <mrow> \langle 3, 0, 1, 5 \rangle\cdot\langle -2, 1, 4, -2 \rangle \amp= 3\cdot(-2) +
        0\cdot1 + 1\cdot4 +5\cdot (-2)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= -6 + 0 + 4 -10= -12</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the resulting quantity is a <em>scalar</em>. In the next section, we will explore another product of vectors for which the resulting quantity is a <em>vector</em>. For this reason, you will sometimes see the phrase <term>scalar product</term> used in place of <q>dot product</q>. 
    </p>


    <p>
      The dot product gives us a way to define a product of two vectors, and we will soon formalize the ideas from <xref ref="PA-dotproduct"/> about what the dot product tells us about the angle between vectors. First, however, we state some useful properties the dot product that show how it behaves in ways that are similar to the product of real numbers. In fact, all of these properties are consequences of properties of addition and multiplication of real numbers.

      In <xref ref="PA-dotproduct"/>, you observed that for two-dimensional vectors, the dot product of a vector with itself is the square of the vector's magnitude. This is so useful, that we state it below.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-dotproduct-mag">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\vu=\langle u_1,u_2,\dots,u_n\rangle</m> is a vector in <m>\R^n</m>, then <m>\vu\cdot \vu = \vecmag{\vu}^2</m>. In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the square of the length of the vector.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We can do this computation directly and find
          <me>
        \vu\cdot\vu = \langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle \cdot \langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle =  u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2 = \vecmag{\vu}^2

          <p>
            We first use the distributive property (twice), which tells us that <me>(\vu+\vv)\cdot (\vu+\vv) = \vu\cdot\vu + \vu\cdot \vv + \vv\cdot \vu + \vv\cdot \vv </me>.
            Using the commutative property, this becomes
            <me>(\vu+\vv)\cdot (\vu+\vv) = \vu\cdot\vu + 2\vu\cdot \vv  + \vv\cdot \vv </me>.
            Since <m>\vu\cdot \vu = \vecmag{\vu}^2</m> and <m>\vv\cdot \vv = \vecmag{\vv}^2</m>, we can now substitute and have
            <me>(\vu+\vv)\cdot (\vu+\vv) = 16 + 2\cdot 3  + 49 = 71 </me>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Using the distributive property, we have <m>t\vu\cdot \vv + \vv\cdot \vv = 0</m>. We can rearrange this to be <m>t\vu\cdot \vv = -\vv\cdot \vv</m>, or <m>t(\vu\cdot \vv) = -\vv\cdot \vv</m>. Since <m>\vu\cdot \vv</m> is a scalar, we can divide by it (so long as it is nonzero) and have <m>t=-(\vv\cdot \vv)/(\vu\cdot \vv)</m>. If <m>\vu\cdot \vv = 0</m>, then any value of <m>t</m> makes the expression <m>0</m> if <m>\vv = \vec{0}</m> and if <m>\vv\neq \vec{0}</m>, then there is no value of <m>t</m> that works.

    <title>The Angle between Vectors</title>
    <p>
      As we saw in <xref ref="PA-dotproduct" />, the sign of the dot product gives us information about the type of angle formed by two vectors. We also saw that the dot product alone does not give us sufficient information to measure the angle. However, with a bit more information about the vectors, we are able to measure the angle, as we will soon see. If we are given two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, there are two angles that these vectors create, as depicted in <xref ref="F_9_3_Angle_between" />. We will call <m>\theta</m>, the smaller of these angles, the <term>angle between these vectors</term><idx><h>vector</h><h>angle between</h></idx>. Notice that <m>\theta</m> lies between 0 and <m>\pi</m> because we would consider the angle from the other side if the angle was greater than <m>\pi</m>.

      The powerful conclusion from <xref ref="E_9_3_dot_angle"/> is that the dot product is a simple algebraic calculation that provides us with important geometric information about the angle between the vectors that would be difficult to determine otherwise. While you normally need to consider if the angle that comes out of an inverse trigonometric function needs to be adjusted based on the context of a problem, we do not need to worry about that with <xref ref="anglebtwvec" /> because the angle measurement and the range of arccosine are both from <m>0</m> to <m>\pi</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>The Dot Product and Orthogonality</title> -->
    <p>
      Many important relationships between vectors arise when the angle between two vectors is a right angle. In this case, we say the vectors are <term>orthogonal</term>. <idx><h>orthogonal</h></idx> For instance, orthogonality often plays a role in optimization problems: to determine the shortest path from a point in <m>\R^3</m> to a given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to the plane. From your prior mathematical experience, you are likely familiar with saying that two objects that form a right angle are <em>perpendicular</em>. When vectors are involved, we prefer to use the term <em>orthogonal</em> because it allows for one (or both) of the vectors to be <m>\vzero</m>, which is a case where we would not say the vectors are perpendicular.
    </p>

    <p>
      As <xref ref="A_9_3_2_a">Activity</xref> indicates, the dot product provides a simple means to determine whether two vectors are orthogonal to one another. In this case,<m>\vu\cdot\vv=\vecmag{\vu}\vecmag{\vv}\cos(\pi/2) = 0</m>, so we make the following important observation.
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="Dot-product-orthogonality">
      <title>The dot product and orthogonality</title>
      <p>
        Two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m> are orthogonal <idx><h>vector</h><h>orthogonal</h></idx><idx><h>orthogonal</h></idx> to each other provided that <m>\vu \cdot \vv = 0</m>.
      </p>

      Earlier in this section we referred to the dot product as measuring how much two vectors move together. We should emphasize that this is a different idea than asking how much of one vector is in the direction of another, which would have a vector as an answer. The relationship between the sign of the dot product and the angle between the vectors reinforces the idea of how much two vectors move together (or apart). We would say two vectors move together a <em>positive</em> amount if they have an acute angle between them, meaning that the net amount of how much the components of the vectors move together/apart is positive. Vectors that do not move together at all would have a right angle between them and thus the dot product would be <em>zero</em>. Vectors with a <em>negative</em> dot product will move opposite each other more than together (as a sum of the components moving together/apart), thus they will have an obtuse angle between them.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      These different orientations of vectors will lead us to seeking to understand how to construct a vector that represents the portion of one vector that is in the direction of (or parallel to) another vector. We examine this question in depth in the next subsection.

      Suppose we want to split the vector <m>\vu</m> into parts that are parallel to <m>\vv</m> and orthogonal to <m>\vv</m>, which we will call <m>\vw_1</m> and <m>\vw_2</m> respectively. In other words, we want to write <m>\vu=\vw_1+\vw_2</m> where <m>\vw_1=k \vv</m> and <m>\vw_2 \cdot \vv =0</m>. Geometrically, this will look like one of the possibilities shown in <xref ref="projexamples" />.

      The vector <m>\vw_1</m> we have been considering in this subsection is so useful that it has specific notation. We use the previous activity to state the following definition.

          Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. The <term>projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m></term> is the vector
          <mdn>
            <mrow>\proj_{\vv} \vu \amp = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv} \vv</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \left(\frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}\right) \frac{\vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}</mrow>

        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p><idx><h>vector</h><h>component in the direction of</h></idx>
      Using the property that the dot prodcut of a vector with itself is the square of the vector's magnitude, we can write <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu = \left(\frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}\right) \frac{\vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}</m>. Since <m>\vv/\vecmag{\vv}</m> is a unit vector, we can see from this form that the magnitude of <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu</m> is <m>(\vu\cdot \vv)/\vecmag{\vv}</m>. We call this scalar the <term>component of <m>\vu</m> in the direction of <m>\vv</m></term> and denote it by
      <me>
        \comp_{\vv} \vu = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}
      </me>.
      Recalling from earlier in the section that <m>\vu\cdot \vv = \vecmag{\vu}\vecmag{\vv}\cos(\theta)</m>, where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, we can also write
      <me>
        \comp_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vecmag{\vu}\vecmag{\vv}\cos(\theta)}{\vecmag{\vv}} = \vecmag{\vu}\cos(\theta)
      </me>.

    <p>
      Vector subtraction also gives us a way to solve for the piece <m>\vw_2</m> of <m>\vu</m> that is orthogonal to <m>\vv</m>. We find <m>\vw_2=\vu-\vw_1= \vu-\frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv \cdot \vv} \vv</m>. The <term>orthogonal projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m></term> is 
      <me>
        \proj_{\perp \vv} \vu = \vu - \proj_{\vv} \vu = \vu - \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv} \vv
      </me>.
      These relationships (for one configuration of <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>) are shown in <xref ref="fig-dotproduct-proj-labeled"/>. <em>Remember that the length of <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu</m> is <m>\comp_{\vv}\vu</m>.</em> Also notice how the arrangement of the vectors provides an illustration of the fact that <m>\vu = \proj_{\vv}\vu + \proj_{\perp \vv}{\vu}</m>.

      Notice in <xref ref="fig-dotproduct-proj-labeled"/> that you can also see 
      <me>
        \cos(\theta) = \frac{\vecmag{\proj_{\vv}\vu}}{\vecmag{\vu}} = \frac{\comp_{\vv}\vu}{\vecmag{\vu}},
      </me>
      which aligns with our earlier formula <m>\comp_{\vv}\vu = \vecmag{\vu}\cos(\theta)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The component of <m>\vu</m> in the direction of <m>\vv</m> will be a scalar measure of how much of <m>\vu</m> is parallel to <m>\vv</m>. In fact, this shows up in the second formula for <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu</m>. Specifically, we can write <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu = (\comp_{\vv} \vu) \frac{\vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}</m>, which separates the projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m> into   how much of <m>\vu</m> is parallel to <m>\vv</m> (a scalar) times the unit vector in the direction of <m>\vv</m>. This useful idea of separating the magnitude of a vector and the direction of a vector (as described by a unit vector) will be used in the analysis of many vector calculations. The first expression for <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv} \vv</m> can be interpreted conceptually as saying the projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m> must be parallel to <m>\vv</m> and <m>\frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv}</m> is closely related to the length of <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu</m>.

        In this example we will look at calculating and making sense of the different parts of the projection of <m>\langle 4,3\rangle </m> onto <m>\langle 0,2 \rangle</m>. For notational purposes, we will let <m>\vu = \langle 4,3\rangle </m> and  <m>\vv = \langle 0,2 \rangle</m>. Applying <xref ref="def-vector-projections" />, we find
        <md>

          <mrow> \amp= \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \langle 0,2 \rangle = \langle 0,3 \rangle </mrow>
        </md>.
        Using the other formula for the projection, we have
        <md>
          <mrow> \proj_\vv \vu \amp= \left(\frac{\langle 4,3\rangle \cdot \langle 0,2 \rangle  }{\vecmag{\langle 0,2 \rangle}} \right) \frac{\langle 0,2 \rangle}{\vecmag{\langle 0,2 \rangle }} </mrow>

          <mrow> \amp= (3) \langle 0,1 \rangle = \langle 0,3 \rangle </mrow>

        We can now compute the orthogonal projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m> using <m>\proj_\vv \vu</m>.
        <me>
          \proj_{\perp \vv} \vu = \vu - \proj_\vv \vu = \langle 4,3 \rangle - \langle 0,3\rangle =\langle 4,0\rangle
        </me>.
        We can summarize these calculations as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m> is asking how much of <m>\langle 4,3 \rangle</m> is in the vertical direction.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m> can be split into the scalar <m>3</m>, the component of <m>\vu</m> in the direction of <m>\vv</m>, and the unit vector in the direction of <m>\vv</m>, <m>\langle 0,1 \rangle </m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The orthogonal projection of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m> will be given by how much of <m>\vu</m> is horizontal because we subtract out all of the vertical component of <m>\vu</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        This example allows us to contrast the precise meaning of the projection vector with the the original interpretation of the dot product. Specifically, we used the dot product of <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> to measure how much these vectors move together and found that <m>\langle 4,3\rangle \cdot \langle 0,2 \rangle=6</m>. So <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> move together a <q>positive</q> amount. This measurement is used in the coefficent for both forms of the projection equation. In the first equation, 
        we use the ratio <m>\frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv}</m> to measure how much <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> move together in comparison to the size of <m>\vv</m>. In the second equation for the projection, we use the ratio <m>\frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vecmag{\vv}}</m> to measure how much <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> move together in comparison to unit vector in the direction of <m>\vv</m>. 
      </p> -->
    </example>
    <p>
      Going forward, we will use the projection more often than the dot product by itself. This is because the projection precisely measures how much of one vector is in a particular direction rather than the much vauger measurement of the type of angle between the vectors.

    <title>Work, Force, and Displacement</title>
    <p>
      In physics, work is a measure of the energy required to apply a force to an object through a displacement. In <xref ref="workex" />, we can see a diagram showing the force applied to a refrigerator (in orange) that is used to move the refrigerator from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m>. The change in location, <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>, is called the <term>displacement</term>. Notice that not all of the force is in the direction of the displacement. The work done on the refrigerator only depends on the amount of force that is in the direction of <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>.

      The work required to move the refrigerator is
      <me>
        W = \vF\cdot\overrightarrow{AB} = \vecmag{\vF} \vecmag{\overrightarrow{AB}} \cos(\theta)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the force applied parallel to the displacement and the length of the displacement. In fact, work is closely related to the projection of the force vector onto the displacement vector. (More precisely, it is the product of the component of the force vector in the direction of the displacement vector times the magnitude of the displacement vector.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The units commonly used for work are Joules or Newton-meters in the metric system and foot-pounds in customary units. (In electrical settings, units such as coulomb-volts or kilowatt-hours may be used.) Note that these units come from work being the dot product of a force vector, using units of Newtons or pounds, and a displacement vector, using units of meters or feet.
