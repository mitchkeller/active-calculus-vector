  <introduction> 
    <p>
      In this section, we will introduce some examples of graphs in two and three dimensions that have nice algebraic properties and a variety of interesting geometric features. For our preview activity, we will recall some properties of graphs and equations that will be useful in describing our new examples. While students may have different levels of experience with graphs like circles, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas, we will focus our work on the correspondence between the algebraic presentations of these shapes and the important geometric features.

    <title>Coordinate Transformations</title>
  <p>
    We have seen how the distance formula leads to the equation of a sphere and how the idea of flat one and two dimensional graphs gave rise to lines and planes. In this section, we will introduce some other curves and surfaces that will be used throughout the rest of this text as examples. These objects will allow us to have graphs with a variety of geometric features while still being algebraically simple. The next activity will go over a couple of basic coordinate transformation ideas that will be helpful in generalizing our common graphs.

    <title>Translation of Coordinates</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this activity we will look at how to translate coordinate systems, which means to use a new coordinate system with axes parallel to to the original set of axes and the same scale. In other words, the new coordinate system has a new origin but does not change the way coordinates are measured. This is very useful to simplify the equation of a graph by making the graph's center the new origin.

The <m>x^*</m> and <m>y^*</m> should parallel to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes and use the same scale.

          While walking your dog, you notice that your dog takes three steps for every step of yours. When you sit down at home you realize that your coordinate system for your house is different than your dog's. You decide to make the origin of both your coordinate system and your dog's to be the entrance to your kitchen. Your dog's bed is eight of your steps south and four steps west of the entrance to the kitchen. The dog's water bowl is 5 of your steps north and 3 steps east from the entrace to your kitchen. The front door of your house is 15 of your steps south and 9 steps east of the entrance to the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Draw a set of axes and plot the location of your dog's bed, water bowl, and the front door in terms of your steps from the origin (the entrance to your kitchen).

Generalize your findings into equations that tranform between <m>(x,y)</m>- and <m>(x',y')</m>-coordinates.

    The results of the previous activities are probably not suprising but should offer some insight into why some aspects of coordinate transformations seem backwards. This is because the transformations are about converting back to the measurement of a different coordinate system.

    You may have seen the ideas of coordinate transformation that were central to <xref ref="coord-translation" />, but hopefully you see precisely where the algebraic transformations come from and how they correspond to simple geometric transformations. For our basic shapes in 2D, we will give a very brief definition for the shape, but the focus of this presentation will be about applying transformations to a basic shape in order to generalize the possible usage of these shapes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A <term>circle</term> is the set of points that are a fixed distance (called the radius) away from a specific point (called the center). Most often, circles are introduced with the center at the origin and the radius given by a constant <m>R</m>. This means that a point <m>(x,y)</m> that is on the circle will satisfy 
    <me>\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2}=R</me>
    which can be expressed as the equivalent equation
    <me>x^2+y^2=R^2</me>
    Applying the same idea to a circle with center <m>(h,k)</m> means you will get an equation like 
    <me>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=R^2</me>
    , which is often called the standard form of the circle. The standard form is convenient to use because the information needed to graph the circle can be read from this form without needing more algebra. For instance, the circle given by <me>(x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=6</me> would have center <m>(2,-3)</m> and radius <m>\sqrt{6}</m>. Notice that the transformation equations from <xref ref="coord-translation" /> show up in this example as we move a circle from being centered at the origin(<m>x^2+y^2=R^2</m>) to a point <m>(h,k)</m> (<m>(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=R^2</m>).

        An <term>ellipse</term> is the set of all points such that the sum of the distances from the point <m>(x,y)</m> to a pair of distinct points (called foci) is a fixed constant. In the interact below, you can use the slider to change the location on the ellipse being displayed. You should see how as you move around the ellipse, the sum of the lengths of the blue and red segments remains constant, as shown compared to the green segment (which is a fixed length).

    While the definition of the ellipse given above has some great applications in engineering, orbital mechanics, and optics, we will focus on the ellipse as a transformation of a circle. While this is not obvious and the details take a little while to prove, any ellipse in the plane can be obtained by transforming a circle (through translation, horizontal/vertical coordinate stretches that are not the same as each other, and rotations of the coordinate systems).

        In the interact above, you can see how as you move around the hyperbola, the difference of the lengths of the blue and red segments remains constant (shown in green). Additionally, you can see that a hyperbola has asymptotic behavior in that as you approach the edges of the plot, the hyperbola will get very close to the asymptote lines (shown with a dashed line).

    <p>
      This section includes a lot of basic transformation ideas that students may have a range of experience with. We included these activities as a way to make sure that students have some exposure and they get to practice simple algebraic procedures that will be used with more complexity later in the text. A more thorough approach to the conic sections can be found at (insert link to IBL materials here). You may want to have students work through activities like <xref ref="coord-translation" /> and <xref ref="coord-scale" /> on their own during times where you don't have a preview activity to prepare for new material.
