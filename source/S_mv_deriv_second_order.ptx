        <p>
          Given a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, how are the second-order partial derivatives of <m>f</m> defined?
        </p>
      </li> 
      <li>
        <p>
          What do the second-order partial derivatives <m>f_{xx}</m>, <m>f_{yy}</m>, <m>f_{xy}</m>, and <m>f_{yx}</m> of a function <m>f</m> tell us about the function's behavior?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall that for a single-variable function <m>f</m>, the second derivative of <m>f</m> is defined to be the derivative of the first derivative. That is, <m>f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\Bigl[ f'(x) \Bigr] = \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}</m>, which can be stated in terms of the limit definition of the derivative by writing
      <me>
        f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In what follows, we begin exploring the four different second-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables and we will explore what these various derivatives tell us about the function's behavior.

    As we saw in the preview activity, we can relate properties of second derivatives from single variable calculus to the behavior of our trace functions. In this section, we will formalize our definitions of the second partial derivatives for a function of two variables and interpret how these give information about the functions behavior. Finally, we will briefly generalize to functions of more than two variables and higher order derivatives.

      A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> has two first order partial derivatives, <m>f_x=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}</m> and <m>f_y=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}</m>. As we saw in Preview <xref ref="PA_10_3">Activity</xref>, each of these first-order partial derivatives has two partial derivatives, giving a total of four <em>second-order</em> partial derivatives<idx><h>partial derivatives</h><h>second-order</h></idx>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f_{xx} = (f_x)_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Bigl[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Bigr] = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f_{yy} = (f_y)_y=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}  \Bigl[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \Bigr] = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f_{xy} = (f_x)_y=\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigl[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Bigr] = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f_{yx}=(f_y)_x=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}  \Bigl[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \Bigr] =  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first two, <m>f_{xx}</m> and <m>f_{yy}</m>, are called <em>unmixed</em> second-order partial derivatives<idx><h>partial derivatives</h><h>second-order, unmixed</h></idx> while the last two, <m>f_{xy}</m> and <m>f_{yx}</m>, are called the <em>mixed</em> second-order partial derivatives<idx><h>partial derivatives</h><h>second-order, mixed</h></idx>.

      One aspect of this notation can be a little confusing. The notation
      <me>
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigl[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Bigr]
      </me>
      means that we first differentiate with respect to <m>x</m> and then with respect to <m>y</m>; this can be expressed in the alternate notation <m>f_{xy} = (f_x)_y</m>. However, to find the second partial derivative
      <me>
        f_{yx} = (f_y)_x
      </me>
      we first differentiate with respect to <m>y</m> and then <m>x</m>. This means
      that
      <me>
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = f_{xy}, 
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y} = f_{yx}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Be sure to note carefully the difference between Leibniz notation and subscript notation and the order in which <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> appear in each. In addition, remember that anytime we compute a partial derivative, we hold constant the variable(s) other than the one we are differentiating with respect to. In both notations, we use the same order of operations idea of working inside out. With the Leibniz notation, that means our partial derivative operators are written before the function we are taking partials of, whereas with the subscript notation writes order of derivatives <em>after</em> the function.

          How many second order partial derivatives does the function <m>h</m> defined by <m>h(x,y,z,t) = 9x^9z-xyz^9 + 9t</m> have? Write a sentence to justify your reasoning on the number of second order partial derivatives of <m>h</m>. Finally, find <m>h_{xz}</m> and <m>h_{zx}</m> (you do not need to find the other second order partial derivatives).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Since <m>h</m> is a function of four independent variables, <m>h</m> has four first-order partial derivatives: <m>h_x, h_y</m>,  <m>h_z</m>, and <m>h_t</m>. Each of those has four partial derivatives, so <m>h</m> has sixteen second-order partial derivatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find <m>h_{xz}</m>, we start by calculating <m>h_x</m>, holding <m>y, z, t</m> constant and differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            h_x (x, y, z) = 81x^8z - yz^9
          </me>
          We then take the partial derivative of <m>h_x</m> with respect to <m>z</m>, holding <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> constant:
          <me>
            h_{xz} (x, y, z) = 81x^8 - 9yz^8
          </me>
          Similarly, to find <m>h_{zx}</m>, we start by calculating <m>h_z</m>, holding <m>x, y, t</m> constant and differentiating with respect to <m>z</m>:
          <me>
            h_z (x, y, z) = 9x^9 - 9xyz^8
          </me>
          We then take the partial derivative of <m>h_z</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, holding <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> constant:
          <me>
            h_{zx} (x, y, z) = 81x^8 - 9yz^8

    In <xref ref="increasing" />, the left curve has the slopes of the tangent liens increasing (from left to right) which means that the function is increasing at an increasing rate. In other words the derivative of the slope of the tangent lines is positive, thus <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m>. We say that this curve is concave up. The middle curve in <xref ref="increasing" /> has tangent lines with the same slope, which means that the function is increasing with constant rate. Thus the derivative of the slope of the tangent lines will be zero. The right curve in <xref ref="increasing" /> has the slope of the tangent lines decreasing (from left to right) which means the function is increasing at a decreasing rate. In other words, the derivative of the slope of the tangent line is negative, so <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m>. We say that this curve is concave down. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A similar argument can be applied to the graphs of decreasing functions, as shown in <xref ref="decreasing"/>. In particular, we can say that the left plot will have negative sloples of tangent lines but those slopes are increasing (from left to right), so <m>f''(x) \gt 0 </m> and the curve is concave up. The middle plot in <xref ref="decreasing"/> has a constant slope for tangent lines along the curve, thus the second derivative is zero. The right plot in <xref ref="decreasing"/> has negative slopes of tangent lines (decreasing graph), and the slopes of those tangent lines are decreasing. Thus <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m> and we say that the graph is concave down.

    Recall from single variable calculus that the second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the derivative. This observation is the key to understanding the meaning of the second-order partial derivatives, but as will be vital throughout this chapter, we must be mindful of the direction associated with each partial derivative.

    Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a point provides us with information about the concavity of the function at that point. 
   --> 
  <p> 
    Since the unmixed second-order partial derivative <m>f_{xx}</m> requires us to hold <m>y</m> constant and differentiate twice with respect to <m>x</m>, we can view <m>f_{xx}</m> as the second derivative of a trace of <m>f</m> where <m>y</m> is fixed. As such, <m>f_{xx}</m> will measure the concavity of this trace. You can use the slider in <xref ref="F_10_3_fxx" /> to change the location of the tangent line shown on the trace given by <m>y=-1.5</m>. As with <em>ALL</em> plots in three dimensions, you should look at the axes or the coordinate values shown in the frame of the plot to make sure you understand which direction corresponds to an increase in each variable. This is especially important with interactive plots like the ones used throughout this text because you may have changed the perspective from the original settings in order to see the plot from a different place.

    You should notice that the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as <m>x</m> increases, and just as in single variable calculus, this is why the trace is concave down. Indeed, we see that <m>f_x(x,y)=\cos(x)e^{-y}</m> and so <m>f_{xx}(x,y)=-\sin(x)e^{-y} \lt  0</m>, since <m>e^{-y} \gt 0</m> for all values of <m>y</m>, including <m>y = -1.5</m>.

        The figures seem to indicate that the slopes of the tangent lines to the trace <m>f(1.75,y)</m> increase as <m>y</m> increases. Note that <m>\frac{d}{dy} f(1.75,y) = \frac{d}{dy} \sin(1.75) e^{-y} = -\sin(1.75) e^{-y}</m>, so as <m>y</m> increases the slopes of the tangent lines become less negative. Note also that <m>\frac{d^2}{dy^2} f(1.75,y) = \sin(1.75)e^{-y}</m> which is a decreasing function. This tells us that the <m>x=1.75</m> trace is concave down. That means that the slopes of the tangent lines to the trace are increasing, but at a decreasing rate. This is reflected in the fact that the surface seems to be leveling off as <m>y</m> increases.

        We want to explore what is described by the mixed partial derivative, <m>f_{xy}</m> and we will focus on the point given by <m>(x,y)=(1.75,-1.5)</m>. We are going to work through the definition for <m>f_{xy} (1.75,-1.5)</m> carefully now.
      </p>
      <p>  
        The partial derivative <m>f_x(1.75,-1.5)</m> measures the slope of the line tangent to the trace given by <m>y=-1.5</m>. The tangent line we are examining is changing in the <m>x</m>-direction. When we look at <m>f_{xy}</m>, we are taking the partial derivative of <m>f_x</m> with respect to <m>y</m>, <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigl[ f_x \Bigr]</m>. So we are looking at how the slope of the tangent line in the <m>x</m>-direction will change when we vary the <m>y</m>-coordinate a little bit. We would approximate <m>f_{xy}(1.75,-1.5)</m> with the following difference quotient:
        <me> \frac{f_x(1.75,-1.5+h)-f_x(1.75,-1.5)}{h}</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        You might think of sliding your pencil down the trace with <m>x=1.5</m> so that the pencil is in the <m>x</m>-direction and tangent to the surface. In <xref ref="F_10_3_fxy">Figure</xref>, the pencil would be the red tangent line drawn. You can use the slider to change the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point where the red tangent line is drawn. You should look at what happens to the slope of the red tangent line as you increase the <m>t</m>-cooridnate with the slider. The tangent line at the point <m>(1.75,-1.5)</m> is drawn in gray for reference purposes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on <xref ref="F_10_3_fxy">Figure</xref>, write a few sentences about whether <m>f_{xy}(1.75, -1.5)</m> is positive or negative and justify your reasoning.

      <p>
        The sketches are shown below. Since <m>f_y(x,y) = -\sin(x)e^{-y}</m>, when <m>x</m> exceeds <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and increases, <m>f_y(x,y)</m> increases for fixed <m>y</m>. So we should expect <m>f_{yx}(1.75,-1.5)</m> to be positive. In fact, <m>f_{yx}(1.75,-1.5) = 0.8</m>. The value of <m>f_{yx}(1.75,-1.5)</m> measures how much the surface <q>twists</q> in the <m>x</m> direction when <m>x=1.75</m> as we move along the <m>y=-1.5</m> trace.

    Just as with the first-order partial derivatives, we can approximate second-order partial derivatives in the situation where we have only partial information about the function, like with tables or contour plots.

        As we saw in <xref ref="A_10_2_12">Activity</xref>, the wind chill <m>w(v,T)</m>, in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed, in miles per hour, and the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit. Some values of the wind chill are recorded in <xref ref="T_10_3_wind_chill">Table</xref>.

          To estimate <m>w_{vT}(20,-10)</m> we use a symmetric difference quotient with
          <m>w_v(20,-15)</m> and <m>w_v(20,-5)</m>.
          Now
          <md>
            <mrow>w_v(20,-15) \approx \frac{w(25,-15)-w(15,-15)}{10} = \frac{-44-(-39)}{10} = -0.5</mrow>
            <mrow>w_v(20,-5) \approx \frac{w(25,-5)-w(15,-5)}{10} = \frac{-31-(-26)}{10} = -0.5</mrow>
          </md>.
          So
          <me>
            w_{vT}(20,-10) \approx \frac{w_v(20,-5) - w_v(20,-15)}{10} \approx 0

          Write a few sentences to explain what the values <m>w_{TT}(20, -10)</m>,  <m>w_{vv}(20,-10)</m>, and <m>w_{Tv}(20,-10)</m> indicate regarding the behavior of <m>w(v,T)</m>.

          The fact that <m>w_{TT}(20, -10) \approx 0.03</m> means that for every one <m>^{\circ}F</m> increase from <m>-10</m> degrees, the rate at which the wind chill changes as the temperature increases grows by approximately 0.03 <m>\frac{^{\circ}F}{^{\circ}F}</m> if the wind speed is 20 miles per hour. The fact that <m>w_{vv}(20, -10) \approx -0.01</m> means that for every one mile per hour increase in the wind speed from 20 miles per hour, at a temperature of <m>-10^{\circ}F</m>, the rate at which the wind chill changes as the wind speed increases declines by approximately 0.01 <m>\frac{^{\circ}F}{\text{ mile/hour } }</m>. The fact that <m>w_{Tv}(20, -10) \approx 0</m> means that there is no change in the rate at which the wind chill changes as the temperature increases if the wind speed increases from 20 miles per hour and the temperature is <m>-10^{\circ}F</m>.

    As we have found in <xref ref="A_10_3_2a">Activities</xref> and <xref ref="A_10_3_6"/>, we may think of <m>f_{xy}</m> as measuring the <q>twist</q> of the graph as we increase <m>y</m> along a particular trace where <m>x</m> is held constant. In the same way, <m>f_{yx}</m> measures how the graph twists as we increase <m>x</m>. If we remember that Clairaut's theorem tells us that <m>f_{xy} = f_{yx}</m>, we see that the amount of twisting is the same in both directions. This twisting is perhaps more easily seen in <xref ref="F_10_3_ruled">Figure</xref>, which shows the graph  of <m>f(x,y) = -xy</m>, for which <m>f_{xy} = -1</m>.

          There are four second-order partial derivatives of a function
            <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
          <me>
            f_{xx} = (f_x)_x,
              f_{xy} = (f_x)_y,
              f_{yx} = (f_y)_x,\ \mbox{and}  \ 
              f_{yy} = (f_y)_y.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The unmixed second-order partial derivatives, <m>f_{xx}</m> and
              <m>f_{yy}</m>, tell us about the concavity of the traces. The mixed second-order partial derivatives, <m>f_{xy}</m> and
              <m>f_{yx}</m>, tell us how the graph of <m>f</m> twists.
